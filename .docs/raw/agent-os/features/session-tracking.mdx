## Overview

Sessions are durable conversation timelines that bind inputs, model outputs, tools, files, metrics, and summaries under a single `session_id`. AgentOS persists sessions for Agents, Teams, and Workflows so you can resume work, audit behavior, and analyze quality over time.

- A session collects ordered runs (each run contains messages, tool calls, and metrics).
- Summaries and metadata help you search, group, and reason about long histories.
- Token usage can be monitored per session via the metrics tab.
- Inspect details about the agent and models tied to each session.

## Accessing Sessions

- Open the `Sessions` section in the sidebar.
- If multiple session databases are configured, pick one from the database selector in the header.
- Switch between `Agents` and `Teams` using the header tabs.
- Click `Reload page` (Refresh) to sync the list and statuses.

## Troubleshooting

- Sessions not loading: Ensure your OS is connected and active, select a session database, then click `Reload page`.
- No sessions yet: Start a conversation to generate sessions.
- Wrong list: Check the `Agents` vs `Teams` tab and sorting.
- Configuration errors: If you see endpoint or database errors, verify your OS endpoint and database settings.
