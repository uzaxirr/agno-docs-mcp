## Overview

The Tracing feature in AgentOS provides deep observability into your agent and team executions. Every run generates a trace containing detailed information about what happened, how long it took, and what resources were used.

- Traces capture the complete execution flow of agents and teams
- Each trace contains spans representing individual operations (LLM calls, tool executions, etc.)
- Each span contains token usage (when relevant), latency, and error information at a glance
- You can filter and search traces to debug issues or analyze performance

<Note>
  <strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Your AgentOS must be connected and active with tracing enabled. If
  you see "Disconnected" or "Inactive," review your{" "}
  <a href="/agent-os/connecting-your-os">connection settings</a>.
</Note>

## Accessing Tracing

- Open the `Tracing` section in the sidebar.
- Click the `Refresh` button to sync the latest traces.

## Filtering Traces

Use the filtering options to quickly find the traces you need:

### View Mode

- **By Session** - Group traces by conversation session to see all activity within a session
- **By Run** - View individual execution runs to analyze specific interactions

### Time Range

- **Quick filters** - Select from preset ranges: last hour, last 24 hours, or last 7 days
- **Custom range** - Pick specific start and end dates for precise time-based filtering

## Trace Views

Click on any trace to view its execution breakdown. You can switch between two visualization modes:

### Tree View

The Tree view displays spans in a hierarchical structure, showing the parent-child relationships between operations. This is useful for understanding how teams delegate to agents and how agents invoke tools.

  </video>
</Frame>

### Waterfall View

The Waterfall view visualizes spans on a time axis, showing when each operation started, how long it took, and which operations ran in parallel. This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
