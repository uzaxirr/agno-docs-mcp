Interfaces enable exposing Agno agents, teams, and workflows through various communication protocols and platforms. Each interface provides a standardized way to connect Agno agents to external systems, messaging platforms, and frontend applications.

## How Interfaces Work

Interfaces are FastAPI routers that mount protocol-specific endpoints on an AgentOS instance. Each interface:

- Wraps Agno agents, teams, or workflows into protocol-compatible endpoints
- Handles authentication and request validation for the target platform
- Manages session tracking and context preservation
- Streams responses back to clients in the appropriate format

## Using Interfaces

Interfaces are added to an AgentOS instance through the `interfaces` parameter:

```python
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.os.interfaces.slack import Slack

agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[my_agent],
    interfaces=[Slack(agent=my_agent)],
)
app = agent_os.get_app()
```

Multiple interfaces can be added to a single AgentOS instance, allowing the same agents to be exposed through different protocols simultaneously.
