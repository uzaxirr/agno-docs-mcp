The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) enables Agents to interact with external systems through a standardized interface.

You can give your Agents access to MCP tools using the `MCPTools` class. Read more about using MCP tools [here](/basics/tools/mcp/overview).

Your `MCPTools` will work normally within AgentOS. Their lifecycle is automatically handled, you don't need to handle their connection and disconnection.

<Note>
If you are using `MCPTools` within AgentOS, you should not use `reload=True` when serving your AgentOS.
This can break the MCP connection during the FastAPI lifecycle.
</Note>

## Example

```python mcp_tools_example.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

# Create MCPTools instance
mcp_tools = MCPTools(
    transport="streamable-http",
    url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp"
)

# Create MCP-enabled agent
agent = Agent(
    id="agno-agent",
    name="Agno Agent",
    tools=[mcp_tools],
)

# AgentOS manages MCP lifespan
agent_os = AgentOS(
    description="AgentOS with MCP Tools",
    agents=[agent],
)

app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Don't use reload=True with MCP tools to avoid lifespan issues
    agent_os.serve(app="mcp_tools_example:app")
```

<Note>
Refreshing the connection to MCP servers is **not** automatically handled. You can use [`refresh_connection`](/basics/tools/mcp/overview#connection-refresh) to manually refresh a connection.
</Note>
