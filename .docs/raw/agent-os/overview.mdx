AgentOS is Agno's production runtime and control plane for deploying and managing your agentic systems at scale. Built on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), it provides a robust, scalable infrastructure that you can run locally during development or deploy to your cloud environment for production workloads.

AgentOS serves as the central hub for your AI agents, teams, and workflows, providing a unified API for execution, monitoring, and management. Whether you're running a single agent or orchestrating complex multi-agent systems, AgentOS gives you the tools to build production-ready agentic applications.

With AgentOS, you can:

- **Run Agents / Teams / Workflows**: Create new runs for your agents, teams and workflows, either with a new session or a existing one.
- **Manage Sessions**: Retrieve, update and delete sessions.
- **Manage Memories**: Retrieve, update and delete memories.
- **Manage Knowledge**: Manage the content of your knowledge base.
- **Manage Evals**: Retrieve, create, delete and update evals.

<Note>
This is the same API that powers the [AgentOS Control Plane](/agent-os/control-plane). However, you can also use these endpoints to power your own application!

See the full [API reference](/reference-api/overview) for more details.

## Create your AgentOS

Below is a basic example of how to create an AgentOS instance:

```python my_os.py
from agno.os import AgentOS

agent_os = AgentOS(
  name="My AgentOS",
  description="My Multi-Agent Runtime",
  agents=[basic_agent],
  teams=[basic_team],
  workflows=[basic_workflow]
)

app = agent_os.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="my_os:app", reload=True)
```

You can configure the behaviour of your AgentOS by passing the following parameters to the `AgentOS` class:

- `agents`: List of agents to include in the AgentOS
- `teams`: List of teams to include in the AgentOS
- `workflows`: List of workflows to include in the AgentOS
- `knowledge`: List of knowledge instances to include in the AgentOS
- `interfaces`: List of interfaces to include in the AgentOS 
  - See the [Interfaces](/agent-os/interfaces) section for more details.
- `config`: Configuration file path or `AgentOSConfig` instance 
  - See the [Configuration](/agent-os/config) page for more details.
- `base_app`: Optional custom FastAPI app to use instead of creating a new one 
  - See the [Custom FastAPI App](/agent-os/custom-fastapi/overview) page for more details.
- `lifespan`: Optional lifespan context manager for the FastAPI app 
  - See the [Lifespan](/agent-os/lifespan) page for more details.
- `enable_mcp_server`: Turn your AgentOS into an MCP server 
  - See the [MCP enabled AgentOS](/agent-os/mcp/mcp) page for more details.

See the [AgentOS class reference](/reference/agent-os/agent-os) for more details.
