`RemoteAgent` allows you to execute agents that are running on a remote AgentOS instance as if they were local agents. This enables distributed architectures where specialized agents run on different servers.

## Prerequisites

You need a running AgentOS instance with at least one agent. See [Creating Your First OS](/agent-os/creating-your-first-os) to set one up.

## Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from agno.agent import RemoteAgent

async def main():
    # Connect to a remote agent
    agent = RemoteAgent(
        base_url="http://remote-server:7778",  # Use localhost for local testing
        agent_id="assistant-agent",
    )
    
    # Run the agent
    response = await agent.arun("What is the capital of France?")
    print(response.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Streaming Responses

Stream responses in real-time for a better user experience:

```python
from agno.agent import RemoteAgent

agent = RemoteAgent(
    base_url="http://remote-server:7778",  # Use localhost for local testing
    agent_id="assistant-agent",
)

async for event in agent.arun(
    "Tell me a story about a brave knight",
    stream=True,
):
    if hasattr(event, "content") and event.content:
        print(event.content, end="", flush=True)
```

## Configuration Access

Access the remote agent's configuration:

```python
from agno.agent import RemoteAgent

agent = RemoteAgent(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    agent_id="assistant-agent",
)

# Access cached properties
print(f"Name: {agent.name}")
print(f"Description: {agent.description}")
print(f"Tools: {agent.tools}")

# Get fresh configuration
config = await agent.get_agent_config()
print(f"Model: {config.model}")

# Force refresh cache
agent.refresh_config()
```

## Authentication

For authenticated AgentOS instances:

```python
from agno.agent import RemoteAgent

agent = RemoteAgent(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    agent_id="assistant-agent",
)

response = await agent.arun(
    "Hello",
    auth_token="your-jwt-token",
)
```

## Error Handling

```python
from agno.agent import RemoteAgent
from agno.exceptions import RemoteServerUnavailableError

agent = RemoteAgent(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    agent_id="assistant-agent",
)

try:
    response = await agent.arun("Hello")
except RemoteServerUnavailableError as e:
    print(f"Cannot connect to server: {e.message}")
    # Handle fallback logic
```
