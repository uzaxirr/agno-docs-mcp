`RemoteTeam` allows you to execute teams that are running on a remote AgentOS instance. This enables you to leverage complex multi-agent teams without hosting them locally.

## Prerequisites

You need a running AgentOS instance with at least one team configured. See [Creating Your First OS](/agent-os/creating-your-first-os) to set one up.

## Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from agno.team import RemoteTeam

async def main():
    # Connect to a remote team
    team = RemoteTeam(
        base_url="http://remote-server:7778",  # Use localhost for local testing
        team_id="research-team",
    )
    
    # Run the team
    response = await team.arun("Research the latest trends in AI")
    print(response.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Streaming Responses

Stream team responses in real-time:

```python
from agno.team import RemoteTeam
from agno.run.team import RunContentEvent

team = RemoteTeam(
    base_url="http://remote-server:7778",  # Use localhost for local testing
    team_id="research-team",
)

print("Team Response: ", end="", flush=True)
async for event in team.arun(
    "Analyze the current state of quantum computing",
    stream=True,
):
    if isinstance(event, RunContentEvent):
        print(event.content, end="", flush=True)
```

## Configuration Access

Access the remote team's configuration:

```python
from agno.team import RemoteTeam

team = RemoteTeam(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    team_id="research-team",
)

# Access cached properties
print(f"Name: {team.name}")
print(f"Description: {team.description}")
print(f"Role: {team.role}")

# Get fresh configuration
config = await team.get_team_config()
print(f"Members: {config.members}")

# Force refresh cache
team.refresh_config()
```

## Using in Gateway

Register remote teams in an AgentOS gateway:

```python
from agno.team import RemoteTeam
from agno.os import AgentOS

gateway = AgentOS(
    id="api-gateway",
    teams=[
        RemoteTeam(base_url="http://server-1:7777", team_id="research-team"),
        RemoteTeam(base_url="http://server-2:7777", team_id="analysis-team"),
    ],
)

gateway.serve(port=7777)
```

## Authentication

For authenticated AgentOS instances:

```python
from agno.team import RemoteTeam

team = RemoteTeam(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    team_id="research-team",
)

response = await team.arun(
    "Research this topic",
    auth_token="your-jwt-token",
)
```

## Error Handling

```python
from agno.team import RemoteTeam
from agno.exceptions import RemoteServerUnavailableError

team = RemoteTeam(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    team_id="research-team",
)

try:
    response = await team.arun("Hello")
except RemoteServerUnavailableError as e:
    print(f"Cannot connect to server: {e.message}")
    # Handle fallback logic
```
