`RemoteWorkflow` allows you to execute workflows that are running on a remote AgentOS instance. This enables you to leverage complex multi-step workflows without hosting them locally.

## Prerequisites

You need a running AgentOS instance with at least one workflow configured. See [Creating Your First OS](/agent-os/creating-your-first-os) to set one up.

## Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from agno.workflow import RemoteWorkflow

async def main():
    # Connect to a remote workflow
    workflow = RemoteWorkflow(
        base_url="http://remote-server:7778",  # Use localhost for local testing
        workflow_id="qa-workflow",
    )
    
    # Run the workflow
    response = await workflow.arun("What are the benefits of using Python?")
    print(response.content)
    print(f"Status: {response.status}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Streaming Responses

Stream workflow responses in real-time:

```python
from agno.workflow import RemoteWorkflow

workflow = RemoteWorkflow(
    base_url="http://remote-server:7778",  # Use localhost for local testing
    workflow_id="story-workflow",
)

print("Workflow Response: ", end="", flush=True)
async for event in workflow.arun(
    "Write a story about space exploration",
    stream=True,
):
    # Handle content from agent steps or workflow completion
    if event.event == "RunContent" and hasattr(event, "content"):
        print(event.content, end="", flush=True)
    elif event.event == "WorkflowAgentCompleted" and hasattr(event, "content"):
        if event.content:
            print(event.content, end="", flush=True)
```

## Passing Additional Data

Send additional structured data to the workflow:

```python
from agno.workflow import RemoteWorkflow

workflow = RemoteWorkflow(
    base_url="http://remote-server:7778",  # Use localhost for local testing
    workflow_id="analysis-workflow",
)

response = await workflow.arun(
    "Analyze the data",
    additional_data={
        "metrics": {"revenue": 1000000, "growth": 0.15},
        "period": "Q4 2024",
    },
)
```

## Configuration Access

Access the remote workflow's configuration:

```python
from agno.workflow import RemoteWorkflow

workflow = RemoteWorkflow(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    workflow_id="qa-workflow",
)

# Access cached properties
print(f"Name: {workflow.name}")
print(f"Description: {workflow.description}")

# Get fresh configuration
config = await workflow.get_workflow_config()

# Force refresh cache
workflow.refresh_config()
```

## Using in Gateway

Register remote workflows in an AgentOS gateway:

```python
from agno.workflow import RemoteWorkflow
from agno.os import AgentOS

gateway = AgentOS(
    id="api-gateway",
    workflows=[
        RemoteWorkflow(base_url="http://server-1:7777", workflow_id="qa-workflow"),
        RemoteWorkflow(base_url="http://server-2:7777", workflow_id="analysis-workflow"),
    ],
)

gateway.serve(port=7777)
```

## Authentication

For authenticated AgentOS instances:

```python
from agno.workflow import RemoteWorkflow

workflow = RemoteWorkflow(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    workflow_id="qa-workflow",
)

response = await workflow.arun(
    "Process this request",
    auth_token="your-jwt-token",
)
```

## Error Handling

```python
from agno.workflow import RemoteWorkflow
from agno.exceptions import RemoteServerUnavailableError

workflow = RemoteWorkflow(
    base_url="http://localhost:7777",
    workflow_id="qa-workflow",
)

try:
    response = await workflow.arun("Hello")
except RemoteServerUnavailableError as e:
    print(f"Cannot connect to server: {e.message}")
    # Handle fallback logic
```
