This example shows how to trace an agent that uses reasoning tools in AgentOS. The traces capture the agent's reasoning process, including all intermediate steps.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```bash
    touch agent_with_reasoning_tools_tracing.py
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the following code to your Python file">
    ```python agent_with_reasoning_tools_tracing.py
    from textwrap import dedent

    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.os import AgentOS
    from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools

    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/traces.db")

    reasoning_agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        tools=[ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True)],
        instructions=dedent("""\
            You are an expert problem-solving assistant with strong analytical skills! 🧠

            Your approach to problems:
            1. First, break down complex questions into component parts
            2. Clearly state your assumptions
            3. Develop a structured reasoning path
            4. Consider multiple perspectives
            5. Evaluate evidence and counter-arguments
            6. Draw well-justified conclusions

            When solving problems:
            - Use explicit step-by-step reasoning
            - Identify key variables and constraints
            - Explore alternative scenarios
            - Highlight areas of uncertainty
            - Explain your thought process clearly
            - Consider both short and long-term implications
            - Evaluate trade-offs explicitly

            For quantitative problems:
            - Show your calculations
            - Explain the significance of numbers
            - Consider confidence intervals when appropriate
            - Identify source data reliability

            For qualitative reasoning:
            - Assess how different factors interact
            - Consider psychological and social dynamics
            - Evaluate practical constraints
            - Address value considerations

  <Step title="Install libraries">
    ```bash
    pip install -U openai agno opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk openinference-instrumentation-agno
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your OpenAI API key">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac/Linux
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run AgentOS">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    python agent_with_reasoning_tools_tracing.py
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    python agent_with_reasoning_tools_tracing.py
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Your AgentOS will be available at `http://localhost:7777`. View traces in the AgentOS dashboard.
