This example shows how to enable tracing for a team in AgentOS. When `tracing=True` is set, all team operations, member agent runs, model calls, and tool executions are automatically captured.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```bash
    touch basic_team_tracing.py
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the following code to your Python file">
    ```python basic_team_tracing.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.os import AgentOS
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

    # Set up database
    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/traces.db")

    # Create member agent - no need to set tracing on each one!
    agent = Agent(
        name="HackerNews Agent",
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
        instructions="You are a hacker news agent. Answer questions concisely.",
        markdown=True,
    )

    team = Team(
        name="HackerNews Team",
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        members=[agent],
        instructions="You are a hacker news team. Answer questions concisely using HackerNews Agent member",
        db=db,
    )

    # Setup AgentOS with tracing enabled
    # This automatically enables tracing for ALL agents and teams!
    agent_os = AgentOS(
        description="Example app for tracing HackerNews",
        teams=[team],
        tracing=True,
    )
    app = agent_os.get_app()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent_os.serve(app="basic_team_tracing:app", reload=True)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install libraries">
    ```bash
    pip install -U openai agno opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk openinference-instrumentation-agno
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your OpenAI API key">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac/Linux
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run AgentOS">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    python basic_team_tracing.py
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    python basic_team_tracing.py
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Your AgentOS will be available at `http://localhost:7777`. View traces in the AgentOS dashboard.
