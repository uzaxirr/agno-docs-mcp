This example demonstrates how to run **all** hooks as FastAPI background tasks by enabling `run_hooks_in_background` at the AgentOS level.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```bash
    touch background_hooks_global.py
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the following code to your Python file">
    ```python background_hooks_global.py
    import asyncio

    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.os import AgentOS
    from agno.run.agent import RunInput


    # Pre-hook for logging requests
    def log_request(run_input: RunInput, agent):
        """
        This pre-hook will run in the background before the agent processes the request.
        Note: Pre-hooks in background mode cannot modify run_input.
        """
        print(f"[Background Pre-Hook] Request received for agent: {agent.name}")
        print(f"[Background Pre-Hook] Input: {run_input.input_content}")


    # Post-hook for logging analytics
    async def log_analytics(run_output, agent, session):
        """
        This post-hook will run in the background after the response is sent.
        It won't block the API response.
        """
        print(f"[Background Post-Hook] Logging analytics for run: {run_output.run_id}")
        print(f"[Background Post-Hook] Agent: {agent.name}")
        print(f"[Background Post-Hook] Session: {session.session_id}")

        # Simulate a slow operation
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        print("[Background Post-Hook] Analytics logged successfully!")


    # Another post-hook for sending notifications
    async def send_notification(run_output, agent):
        """
        Another background task that sends notifications without blocking the response.
        """
        print(f"[Background Post-Hook] Sending notification for agent: {agent.name}")
        # Simulate a slow operation
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        print("[Background Post-Hook] Notification sent!")


    # Create an agent with hooks
    agent = Agent(
        id="background-task-agent",
        name="BackgroundTaskAgent",
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant",
        db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agent.db"),
        pre_hooks=[log_request],
        post_hooks=[log_analytics, send_notification],
        markdown=True,
    )

    # Create AgentOS with background hooks enabled
    agent_os = AgentOS(
        agents=[agent],
        run_hooks_in_background=True,  # All hooks run in background
    )

    # Get the FastAPI app
    app = agent_os.get_app()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        agent_os.serve(app="background_hooks_global:app", port=7777, reload=True)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Snippet file="create-venv-step.mdx" />

  <Step title="Install libraries">
    ```bash
    pip install -U agno openai uvicorn
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your OpenAI API key">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac/Linux
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the server">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac/Linux
    python background_hooks_global.py
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    python background_hooks_global.py
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the endpoint">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/agents/background-task-agent/runs \
      -F "message=Hello, how are you?" \
      -F "stream=false"
    ```

    The response will be returned immediately. Check the server logs to see the background hooks executing after the response is sent.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## What Happens

1. The agent processes the request
2. The response is sent immediately to the user
3. All pre-hooks and post-hooks run in the background
4. The user doesn't have to wait for these tasks to complete

<Note>
With `run_hooks_in_background=True` on AgentOS, **all** hooks for all agents run in the background. Use the `@hook` decorator for more granular control over which hooks run in the background.
</Note>
