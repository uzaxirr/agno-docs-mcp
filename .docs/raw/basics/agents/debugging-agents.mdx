Agno comes with a exceptionally well-built debug mode that helps you understand the flow of execution and the intermediate steps. For example:
- Inspect the messages sent to the model and the response it generates.
- Trace intermediate steps and monitor metrics like token usage, execution time, etc.
- Inspect tool calls, errors, and their results. This can help you identify issues with your tools.

## Debug Mode

To enable debug mode:

1. Set the `debug_mode` parameter on your agent, to enable it for all runs.
2. Set the `debug_mode` parameter on the `run` method, to enable it for the current run.
3. Set the `AGNO_DEBUG` environment variable to `True`, to enable debug mode for all agents.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    instructions="Write a report on the topic. Output only the report.",
    markdown=True,
    debug_mode=True,
    # debug_level=2, # Uncomment to get more detailed logs
)

# Run agent and print response to the terminal
agent.print_response("Trending startups and products.")
```

<Tip>
You can set `debug_level=2` to get even more detailed logs.

Here's how it looks:

  <video

    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
  >
    <source src="/videos/debug_mode.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Frame>

## Interactive CLI

Agno also comes with a pre-built interactive CLI that runs your Agent as a command-line application.

You can use this to test back-and-forth conversations with your agent:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db"),
    add_history_to_context=True,
    num_history_runs=3,
    markdown=True,
)

# Run agent as an interactive CLI app
agent.cli_app(stream=True)
```
