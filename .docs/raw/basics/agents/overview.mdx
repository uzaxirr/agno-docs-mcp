**Agents are AI programs where a language model controls the flow of execution.**

The core of an agent is a model that uses tools in a loop, guided by instructions.

- **Model:** controls the flow of execution. It decides whether to reason, use tools or respond.
- **Instructions:** guides the model on how to use tools and respond.
- **Tools:** enable the model to take actions and interact with external systems.

With Agno, you can also give your Agents memory, knowledge, storage and the ability to reason:

- **Memory:** gives Agents the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn and improve their responses.
- **Storage:** enables Agents to save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless and storage makes Agents stateful, enabling multi-turn conversations.
- **Knowledge:** information the Agent can search at runtime to provide better responses. Knowledge is stored in a vector db and this search at runtime pattern is known as **Agentic RAG** or **Agentic Search**.
- **Reasoning:** enables Agents to "think" and "analyze" the results of their actions before responding, this improves reliability and quality of responses.

## From Agents to Multi-Agent Systems

Agno provides two higher level abstractions for building beyond single agents:

- [**Team**](/basics/teams/overview): a collection of agents (or sub-teams) that work together. Each team member can have different expertise, tools and instructions, allowing for specialized problem-solving approaches.

- [**Workflow**](/basics/workflows/overview): orchestrate agents, teams and functions through a series of defined steps. Workflows provide structured automation with predictable behavior, ideal for tasks that need reliable, repeatable processes.
