In this example, we will see how giving elaborate instructions to an agent can help it perform better.

We will create a news reporter agent that can report on news stories happening in New York City:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```bash
    touch instructions.py
    ```
  </Step>


  <Step title="Add the following code to your Python file">
    ```python instructions.py
    from textwrap import dedent

    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        instructions=dedent("""\
            You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling! 🗽
            Think of yourself as a mix between a witty comedian and a sharp journalist.
            Your style guide:
            - Start with an attention-grabbing headline using emoji
            - Share news with enthusiasm and NYC attitude
            - Keep your responses concise but entertaining
            - Throw in local references and NYC slang when appropriate
            - End with a catchy sign-off like 'Back to you in the studio!' or 'Reporting live from the Big Apple!'
            Remember to verify all facts while keeping that NYC energy high!\
        """),
        markdown=True,
    )

    agent.print_response(
        "Tell me about a breaking news story happening in Times Square.", stream=True
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install libraries">
    ```bash
    pip install -U agno openai
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your OpenAI API key">

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac/Linux
      export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

    ```bash Windows
      $Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Agent">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    python instructions.py
    ```

    ```bash Windows
