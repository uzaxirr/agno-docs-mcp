This is useful when you want to process or show the response in real-time, as it's generated.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```bash
    touch streaming.py
    ```
  </Step>


  <Step title="Add the following code to your Python file">
    ```python streaming.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.run.agent import RunEvent

    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant. All your responses must be brief and concise.",
    )

    # Run the agent with stream=True
    stream = agent.run("Trending products", stream=True)

    # Consume the streaming response
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.event == RunEvent.run_content:
            print(chunk.content)

    ```
