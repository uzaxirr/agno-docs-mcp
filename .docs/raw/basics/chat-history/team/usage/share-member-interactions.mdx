sidebarTitle: Share Member Interactions

This example demonstrates a team where member interactions during the current run are shared with other members through `share_member_interactions=True`.

This allows members to see what other members have done during the same run, enabling better coordination and avoiding duplicate work.

## How it Works

When `share_member_interactions=True`, interaction details are appended to tasks sent to members:

```
<member_interaction_context>
- Member: User Profile Agent
- Task: Get the user's profile information
- Response: {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com", ...}

- Member: Technical Support Agent
- Task: Answer technical support questions
- Response: Here's how to change your billing address...
</member_interaction_context>
```

This allows the Billing Agent to see that the User Profile Agent has already retrieved the user's information, avoiding duplicate tool calls.

## When to Use

Use `share_member_interactions=True` when:
- Multiple members might need the same information
- You want to avoid duplicate API calls or tool executions
- Members need to coordinate their actions during a single run
- One member's work builds on another's within the same request


## Code

```python share_member_interactions.py
from uuid import uuid4

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.team.team import Team


def get_user_profile() -> dict:

        "billing_address": "123 Main St, Anytown, USA",
        "login_type": "email",
        "mfa_enabled": True,
    }


user_profile_agent = Agent(

    instructions=[

        "Get the user's profile information first if the question is about the user's profile or account.",
    ],
    db=SqliteDb(
        db_file="tmp/technical_support_team.db"
    ),  # Add a database to store the conversation history. This is a requirement for history to work correctly.
    share_member_interactions=True,  # Send member interactions DURING the current run to the other members.
    show_members_responses=True,
)


session_id = f"conversation_{uuid4()}"

## Ask question about technical support
support_team.print_response(
    "What is my billing address and how do I change it?",
    stream=True,
    session_id=session_id,
)

support_team.print_response(
    "Do I have multi-factor enabled? How do I disable it?",
    stream=True,
    session_id=session_id,
)
```
