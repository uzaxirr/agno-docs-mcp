Agno supports using In-Memory storage with the `InMemoryDb` class. By doing this, you will be able to use all features that depend on having a database, without having to set one up.

<Warning>
Using the In-Memory storage is not recommended for production applications.
Use it for demos, testing and any other use case where you don't want to setup a database.
</Warning>

## Usage

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.in_memory import InMemoryDb

# Setup in-memory database
db = InMemoryDb()

# Create agent with database
agent = Agent(db=db)
```
