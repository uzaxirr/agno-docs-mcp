Dynamic user input lets your agent decide when it needs information from the user and proactively request it during execution. Unlike the [User Input](/basics/hitl/user-input) pattern where you predefine which tools need user input, this pattern gives the agent autonomy to pause and ask for information whenever it realizes it doesn't have what it needs.

This pattern is ideal when:

- **The interaction flow is unpredictable**: The agent might need different information based on context
- **You want a conversational experience**: Let the agent guide the user through a form-like interaction
- **The agent should be intelligent about what it needs**: Rather than blindly requesting predefined fields, the agent determines what's missing

## How It Works

The `UserControlFlowTools` toolkit provides your agent with a special `get_user_input` tool. When the agent realizes it's missing information:

1. **Agent calls `get_user_input`** with a list of fields it needs filled
2. **Execution pauses** and requirements are added to the returned `RunOutput`
3. **`user_input_schema` populated** in the requirement, with the input schema the agent created
4. **You collect the user's input** and set field values in `user_input_schema`
5. **Call `continue_run()`** to resume with the filled values
6. **Repeat if needed**: Agent may request more information based on previous responses

The key difference from other HITL patterns: the *agent* decides what fields to request and when to request them.

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    tools=[EmailTools(), UserControlFlowTools()],
    markdown=True,
)

run_response = agent.run("Send an email with the body 'What is the weather in Tokyo?'")

# We use a while loop to continue the running until the agent is satisfied with the user input
while run_response.is_paused:
    for requirement in run_response.active_requirements:
        if requirement.needs_user_input:
            input_schema: List[UserInputField] = requirement.user_input_schema  # type: ignore

            for field in input_schema:
                # Get user input for each field in the schema
                field_type = field.field_type  # type: ignore
                field_description = field.description  # type: ignore

                # Display field information to the user
                print(f"\nField: {field.name}")  # type: ignore
                print(f"Description: {field_description}")
                print(f"Type: {field_type}")

                # Get user input
                if field.value is None:  # type: ignore
                    user_value = input(f"Please enter a value for {field.name}: ")  # type: ignore
                else:
                    print(f"Value: {field.value}")  # type: ignore
                    user_value = field.value  # type: ignore

                # Update the field value
                field.value = user_value  # type: ignore

    run_response = agent.continue_run(
        run_id=run_response.run_id,
        requirements=run_response.requirements,
    )
    if not run_response.is_paused:
        pprint.pprint_run_response(run_response)
        break
```

In this example, the agent identifies that it's missing the email subject and recipient address, so it proactively calls `get_user_input` to collect that information. Pretty smart!

## Understanding the `get_user_input` Tool

When your agent calls the `get_user_input` tool, it provides a list of fields using this format:

```python
{
    "field_name": "subject",      # The field identifier
    "field_type": "str",           # Python type (str, int, float, bool, list, dict, etc.)
    "field_description": "The subject of the email"  # Helpful description for the user
}
```

The agent constructs these fields intelligently based on what it needs. For example, if it's trying to send an email but doesn't have the recipient, it might request:

```python
[
    {"field_name": "to_address", "field_type": "str", "field_description": "The email address to send to"},
    {"field_name": "subject", "field_type": "str", "field_description": "The subject line for the email"}
]
```

These fields then appear in `tool.user_input_schema` as `UserInputField` objects that you can iterate through and fill. For a detailed breakdown of the `UserInputField` structure, see [Understanding UserInputField](/basics/hitl/user-input#understanding-userinputfield).

## The While Loop Pattern

Notice the `while run_response.is_paused:` loop? This is crucial for dynamic user input, because the agent might request input multiple times:

```python
run_response = agent.run("Send an email and schedule a meeting")

# First iteration: Agent needs email details
while run_response.is_paused:
    for requirement in run_response.requirements:
        if requirement.needs_user_input:
            for field in requirement.user_input_schema:
                if field.value is None:
                    field.value = input(f"Enter {field.name}: ")

    run_response = agent.continue_run(run_id=run_response.run_id, requirements=run_response.requirements)
    # Agent might pause again if it needs meeting details!
```

The agent could:
1. First ask for email details
2. Send the email
3. Realize it needs meeting details
4. Pause again to request those fields
5. Complete the task

This multi-round capability makes the pattern extremely flexible.

<Note>
**Important**: Always check `field.value` before prompting. If the agent has already filled a field based on context (like extracting it from the user's message), `field.value` won't be `None` and you shouldn't overwrite it.
</Note>

## Customizing Toolkit Behavior

The `UserControlFlowTools` toolkit comes with default instructions that guide the agent, but you can customize them:

```python
from agno.tools.user_control_flow import UserControlFlowTools

# Custom instructions for your use case
custom_instructions = """
When you need user input:
1. Only request fields you absolutely need
2. Group related fields together
3. Provide clear, concise descriptions
4. Never request the same information twice
"""

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[
        EmailTools(),
        UserControlFlowTools(
            instructions=custom_instructions,
            add_instructions=True
        )
    ],
    markdown=True,
)
```

You can also disable the tool entirely if needed:

```python
UserControlFlowTools(enable_get_user_input=False)
```

## Handling Pre-Filled Values

The agent can pre-fill some fields based on the conversation context. This works the same way as in [User Input](/basics/hitl/user-input#handling-pre-filled-values)—always check `field.value` before prompting:

```python
for field in tool.user_input_schema:
    if field.value is None:
        user_value = input(f"Please enter {field.name}: ")
        field.value = user_value
    else:
        print(f"{field.name} (provided by agent): {field.value}")
```

For a more detailed explanation of how pre-filled values work, see the [Handling Pre-Filled Values](/basics/hitl/user-input#handling-pre-filled-values) section in the User Input documentation.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use a while loop**: The agent may need multiple rounds of input
2. **Check field values**: Don't overwrite fields the agent has already filled
3. **Provide clear prompts**: Use the `field.description` to help users understand what's needed
4. **Validate input**: Add your own validation before setting `field.value`
5. **Handle interruptions gracefully**: Store `run_id` to resume later if needed

## Async Support

Dynamic user input works seamlessly with async agents. Use `arun()` and `acontinue_run()` for asynchronous flows:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.user_control_flow import UserControlFlowTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[EmailTools(), UserControlFlowTools()],
    markdown=True,
)

run_response = await agent.arun("Send an email")

while run_response.is_paused:
    for requirement in run_response.active_requirements:
        if requirement.needs_user_input:
            for field in requirement.user_input_schema:
                if field.value is None:
                    field.value = input(f"Please enter {field.name}: ")

    run_response = await agent.acontinue_run(run_id=run_response.run_id, requirements=run_response.requirements)
```

## Streaming Support

Dynamic user input also works with streaming. The agent will emit events until it needs user input, then pause:

```python
run_response = agent.run("Send an email", stream=True)

for run_event in run_response:
    if run_event.is_paused:
        for requirement in run_event.active_requirements:
            if requirement.needs_user_input:
                for field in requirement.user_input_schema:
                    if field.value is None:
                        field.value = input(f"Please enter {field.name}: ")

        # Continue streaming
        for continued_event in agent.continue_run(
            run_id=run_event.run_id,
            requirements=run_event.requirements,
            stream=True
        ):
            print(continued_event.content)
```

## When to Use This Pattern

**Use Dynamic User Input when:**
- The agent needs to adapt its questions based on previous responses
- You want the agent to intelligently determine what information is missing
- The interaction flow changes based on context

**Use [User Input](/basics/hitl/user-input) when:**
- You know exactly which tool fields require user input upfront
- The input requirements are always the same
- You want more explicit control over what gets asked

<Warning>
Remember that tools marked with `@tool(requires_user_input=True)` are mutually exclusive with `@tool(requires_confirmation=True)` and `@tool(external_execution=True)`.

A tool can only use one of these patterns at a time.
