description: Essential concepts and terminology for understanding how Knowledge works in Agno agents.

This reference guide defines the key concepts and terminology commonly encountered when working with Knowledge in Agno.

## Key Terminology

### Knowledge Base
A structured repository of information that agents can search and retrieve from at runtime. Contains processed content optimized for AI understanding and retrieval.

### Agentic RAG
**Retrieval Augmented Generation** where the agent actively decides when to search, what to search for, and how to use the retrieved information. Unlike traditional RAG systems, the agent has full control over the search process.

### Vector Embeddings
Mathematical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Words and phrases with similar meanings have similar embeddings, enabling intelligent search beyond keyword matching.

### Chunking
The process of breaking large documents into smaller, manageable pieces that are optimal for search and retrieval while preserving context.

### Dynamic Few-Shot Learning
The pattern where agents retrieve specific examples or context at runtime to improve their performance on tasks, rather than having all information provided upfront.

**Scenario:** Building a Text-to-SQL Agent

Instead of cramming all table schemas, column names, and example queries into the system prompt, you store this information in a knowledge base.

When a user asks for data, the agent:
1. Analyzes the request
2. Searches for relevant schema information and example queries
3. Uses the retrieved context to generate the best possible SQL query

This is "dynamic" because the agent gets exactly the information it needs for each specific query, and "few-shot" because it learns from examples retrieved at runtime.

## Core Knowledge Components

### Content Sources
The raw information agents need access to:
- **Documents**: PDFs, Word files, text files
- **Websites**: URLs, web pages, documentation sites
- **Databases**: SQL databases, APIs, structured data
- **Text**: Direct text content, notes, policies

### Readers
Specialized components that parse different content types and extract meaningful text:
- **PDFReader**: Extracts text from PDF files, handles encryption
- **WebsiteReader**: Crawls web pages and extracts content
- **CSVReader**: Processes tabular data from CSV files
- **Custom Readers**: Build your own for specialized data sources

### Chunking Strategies
Methods for breaking content into optimal pieces:
- **Semantic Chunking**: Respects natural content boundaries
- **Fixed Size**: Uniform chunk sizes with overlap
- **Document Chunking**: Preserves document structure
- **Recursive Chunking**: Hierarchical splitting with multiple separators

### Vector Databases
Storage systems optimized for similarity search:
- **PgVector**: PostgreSQL extension for vector storage
- **LanceDB**: Fast, embedded vector database
- **Pinecone**: Managed vector database service
- **Qdrant**: High-performance vector search engine

## Component Relationships

The Knowledge system combines these components in a coordinated pipeline: **Readers** → **Chunking** → **Embedders** → **Vector Databases** → **Agent Retrieval**.

## Advanced Knowledge Features

### Custom Knowledge Retrievers
For complete control over how agents search your knowledge:

```python
def custom_retriever(
    agent: Agent,
    query: str,
    num_documents: Optional[int] = 5,
    **kwargs
) -> Optional[list[dict]]:
    # Custom search logic
    # Filter by user permissions
    # Apply business rules
    # Return curated results
    pass

agent = Agent(knowledge_retriever=custom_retriever)
```

### Asynchronous Operations
Optimize performance with async knowledge operations:

```python
# Async content loading for better performance
await knowledge.add_content_async(path="large_dataset/")

# Async agent responses
response = await agent.arun("What's in the dataset?")
```

### Knowledge Filtering
Control what information agents can access:

```python
# Filter by metadata
knowledge.add_content(
    path="docs/",
    filters={"department": "engineering", "clearance": "public"}
)
```
