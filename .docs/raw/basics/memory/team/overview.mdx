The team can also manage user memories, just like agents:

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

db = SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db")

team_with_memory = Team(
    name="Team with Memory",
    members=[agent1, agent2],
    db=db,
    enable_user_memories=True,
)

team_with_memory.print_response("Hi! My name is John Doe.")
team_with_memory.print_response("What is my name?")
```
