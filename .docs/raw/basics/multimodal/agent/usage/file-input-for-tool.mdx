title: File Input for Tools
---

This example demonstrates how tools can access and process files (PDFs, documents, etc.) passed to the agent. It shows uploading a PDF file, processing it with a custom tool, and having the LLM respond based on the extracted content.

## Code

```python file_input_for_tool.py
"""
Example showing how tools can access media (images, videos, audio, files) passed to the agent.

This demonstrates:
1. Uploading a PDF file to an agent
2. A tool that can access and process the uploaded file (OCR simulation)
3. The LLM responding based on the tool's processing result
