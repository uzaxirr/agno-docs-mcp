Similar to providing audio inputs, you can also get audio outputs from an agent. Take a look at the [compatibility matrix](/basics/models/compatibility#multimodal-support) to see which models support audio as output.

## Audio response modality

The following example demonstrates how some models can directly generate audio as part of their response.

```python audio_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunOutput
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.audio import write_audio_to_file

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(
        id="gpt-5-mini-audio-preview",
        modalities=["text", "audio"],
        audio={"voice": "alloy", "format": "wav"},
    ),
    markdown=True,
)
response: RunOutput = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second scary story")

# Save the response audio to a file
if response.response_audio is not None:
    write_audio_to_file(
        audio=agent.run_response.response_audio.content, filename="tmp/scary_story.wav"
    )
```

<Check>
  You can find the audio response in the `RunOutput.response_audio` object.
</Check>

<Note>
There is a distinction between audio response modality and generated audio artifacts. When the model responds with audio, it is stored in the `RunOutput.response_audio` object. The generated audio artifacts are stored in the `RunOutput.audio` list.
</Note>

## Audio input and Audio output

The following example demonstrates how to provide a combination of audio and text inputs to an agent and obtain both text and audio outputs.

```python audio_agent.py
import requests
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.media import Audio
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.audio import write_audio_to_file
from rich.pretty import pprint

# Fetch the audio file and convert it to a base64 encoded string
url = "https://openaiassets.blob.core.windows.net/$web/API/docs/audio/alloy.wav"
response = requests.get(url)
response.raise_for_status()
wav_data = response.content

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(
        id="gpt-5-mini-audio-preview",
        modalities=["text", "audio"],
        audio={"voice": "sage", "format": "wav"},
    ),
    markdown=True,
)

run_response = agent.run(
    "What's in these recording?",
    audio=[Audio(content=wav_data, format="wav")],
)

if run_response.response_audio is not None:
    pprint(run_response.content)
    write_audio_to_file(
        audio=run_response.response_audio.content, filename="tmp/result.wav"
    )
```
