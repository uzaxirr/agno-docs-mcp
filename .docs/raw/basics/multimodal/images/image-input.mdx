Agno supports images as input to agents and teams.  Take a look at the [compatibility matrix](/basics/models/compatibility#multimodal-support) to see which models support images as input.

Let's create an agent that can understand images and make tool calls as needed

```python
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.media import Image
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
        markdown=True,
    )

    agent.print_response(
        "Tell me about this image and give me the latest news about it.",
        images=[
            Image(
                url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/GoldenGateBridge-001.jpg"
            )
        ],
        stream=True,
    )
```
