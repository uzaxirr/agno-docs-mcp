Agno provides comprehensive multimodal support, enabling agents and teams to process and generate content across multiple formats including text, images, audio, video, and files. This allows you to build sophisticated AI applications that can understand and create rich media content.

Multimodal capabilities enable powerful use cases such as image analysis with contextual responses, audio transcription and generation, video processing, and document understanding.

For a complete overview of model compatibility and supported modalities, please check out the [compatibility matrix](/basics/models/compatibility#multimodal-support).
