**The problem:** Regular models often rush to answers on complex problems, missing steps or making logical errors.

**The solution:** Enable `reasoning=True` and watch your model break down the problem, explore multiple approaches, validate results, and deliver thoroughly vetted solutions.

**The beauty?** It works with any model, from GPT-4o to Claude to local models via Ollama. You're not limited to specialized reasoning models.

## How It Works

Enable reasoning on any agent by setting `reasoning=True`:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),  # Any model works
    reasoning=True,
)
```

Behind the scenes, Agno creates a **separate reasoning agent instance** that uses your same model but with specialized prompting that guides it through a rigorous 6-step reasoning framework:

### The Reasoning Framework

1. **Problem Analysis**

   - Restate the task to ensure full comprehension
   - Identify required information and necessary tools

2. **Decompose and Strategize**

   - Break down the problem into subtasks
   - Develop multiple distinct approaches

3. **Intent Clarification and Planning**

   - Articulate the user's intent
   - Select the best strategy with clear justification
   - Create a detailed action plan

4. **Execute the Action Plan**

   - For each step: document title, action, result, reasoning, next action, and confidence score
   - Call tools as needed to gather information
   - Self-correct if errors are detected

5. **Validation (Mandatory)**

   - Cross-verify with alternative approaches
   - Use additional tools to confirm accuracy
   - Reset and revise if validation fails

6. **Final Answer**
   - Deliver the thoroughly validated solution
   - Explain how it addresses the original task

The reasoning agent works through these steps iteratively (up to 10 by default), building on previous results, calling tools, and self-correcting until it reaches a confident solution. Once complete, it hands the full reasoning back to your main agent for the final response.

### How It Differs by Model Type

**With regular models** (gpt-4o, Claude Sonnet, Gemini):

- Forces structured chain-of-thought through the 6-step framework
- Creates detailed reasoning steps with confidence scores
- **This is where reasoning agents shine**: transforming any model into a reasoning system

**With native reasoning models** (gpt-5-mini, DeepSeek-R1, o3-mini):

- Uses the model's built-in reasoning capabilities
- Adds a validation pass from your main agent
- Useful for critical tasks but often unnecessary overhead for simpler problems

## Basic Example

Let's transform a regular GPT-4o model into a reasoning system:

```python reasoning_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Transform a regular model into a reasoning system
reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    reasoning=True,
    markdown=True,
)

reasoning_agent.print_response(
    "Solve the trolley problem. Evaluate multiple ethical frameworks. Include an ASCII diagram of your solution.",
    stream=True,
    show_full_reasoning=True,  # Shows the complete reasoning process
)
```

### What You'll See

With `show_full_reasoning=True`, you'll see:

- **Each reasoning step** with its title, action, and result
- **The agent's thought process** including why it chose each approach
- **Tool calls made** during reasoning (if tools are provided)
- **Validation checks** performed to verify the solution
- **Confidence scores** for each step (0.0–1.0)
- **Self-corrections** if the agent detects errors
- **The final polished response** from your main agent

## Reasoning with Tools

Here's where reasoning agents truly excel: combining multi-step reasoning with tool use. The reasoning agent can call tools iteratively, analyze results, and build toward a comprehensive solution.

```python finance_reasoning.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=["Use tables to display data"],
    reasoning=True,
    markdown=True,
)

reasoning_agent.print_response(
    "Compare the market performance of NVDA, AMD, and INTC over the past quarter. What are the key drivers?",
    stream=True,
    show_full_reasoning=True,
)
```

The reasoning agent will:

1. Break down the task (need stock data for 3 companies)
2. Use DuckDuckGo to search for current market data
3. Analyze each company's performance
4. Search for news about key drivers
5. Validate findings across multiple sources
6. Create a comprehensive comparison with tables
7. Provide a final answer with clear insights

## Configuration Options

### Display Options

Want to peek under the hood? Control what you see during reasoning:

```python
agent.print_response(
    "Your question",
    show_full_reasoning=True,  # Display complete reasoning process (default: False)
)
```

### Capturing Reasoning Events

For building custom UIs or programmatically tracking reasoning progress, you can capture reasoning events (`ReasoningStarted`, `ReasoningStep`, `ReasoningCompleted`) as they happen during streaming. See the [Reasoning Reference](/reference/reasoning/reasoning#reasoning-event-types) for event attributes and complete code examples.

### Iteration Control

Adjust how many reasoning steps the agent takes:

```python
reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    reasoning=True,
    reasoning_min_steps=2,  # Minimum reasoning steps (default: 1)
    reasoning_max_steps=15,  # Maximum reasoning steps (default: 10)
)
```

- **`reasoning_min_steps`**: Ensures the agent thinks through at least this many steps before answering
- **`reasoning_max_steps`**: Prevents infinite loops by capping the iteration count

### Custom Reasoning Agent

For advanced use cases, you can provide your own reasoning agent:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Create a custom reasoning agent with specific instructions
custom_reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions=[
        "Focus heavily on mathematical rigor",
        "Always provide step-by-step proofs",
    ],
)

main_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    reasoning=True,
    reasoning_agent=custom_reasoning_agent,  # Use your custom agent
)
```

## When to Use Reasoning Agents

**Use reasoning agents when:**

- Your task requires multiple sequential steps
- You need the agent to call tools iteratively and build on results
- You want automated chain-of-thought without manually calling reasoning tools
- You need self-validation and error correction
- The problem benefits from exploring multiple approaches before settling on a solution

**Consider alternatives when:**

- You're using a native reasoning model (gpt-5-mini, DeepSeek-R1) for simple tasks: just use the model directly
- You want explicit control over when the agent thinks vs. acts: use [Reasoning Tools](/basics/reasoning/reasoning-tools) instead
- The task is straightforward and doesn't require multi-step thinking

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Start with `reasoning_max_steps=5` for simpler problems to avoid
  unnecessary overhead. Increase to 10-15 for complex multi-step tasks. Monitor
  with `show_full_reasoning=True` to see how many steps your agent actually
  needs.
