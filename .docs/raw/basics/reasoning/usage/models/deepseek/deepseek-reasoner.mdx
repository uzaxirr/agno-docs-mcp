  <Step title="Add the following code to your Python file">
    ```python deepseek_reasoner.py
    from agno.agent import Agent

    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

    task = (
        "You are a philosopher tasked with analyzing the classic 'Trolley Problem'. In this scenario, a runaway trolley "
        "is barreling down the tracks towards five people who are tied up and unable to move. You are standing next to "
        "a large stranger on a footbridge above the tracks. The only way to save the five people is to push this stranger "
        "off the bridge onto the tracks below. This will kill the stranger, but save the five people on the tracks. "
        "Should you push the stranger to save the five people? Provide a well-reasoned answer considering utilitarian, "
        "deontological, and virtue ethics frameworks. "
        "Include a simple ASCII art diagram to illustrate the scenario."
