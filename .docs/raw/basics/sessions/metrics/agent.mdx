When you run an agent in Agno, the response you get (**RunOutput**) includes detailed metrics about the run. These metrics help you understand resource usage (like **token usage** and **time**), performance, and other aspects of the model and tool calls.

Metrics are available at multiple levels:
- **Per message**: Each message (assistant, tool, etc.) has its own metrics.
- **Per run**: Each `RunOutput` has its own metrics.
- **Per session**: The `AgentSession` contains aggregated `session_metrics` that are the sum of all `RunOutput.metrics` for the session.


## Example Usage
Suppose you have an agent that performs some tasks and you want to analyze the metrics after running it. Here's how you can access and print the metrics:

You run the following code to create an agent and run it with the following configuration:
```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.google import Gemini
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from rich.pretty import pprint

agent = Agent(
    model=Gemini(id="gemini-2.5-flash"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db"),
    markdown=True,
)

run_response = agent.run(
    "What is current news in the world?"
)

# Print metrics per message
if run_response.messages:
    for message in run_response.messages:
        if message.role == "assistant":
            if message.content:
                print(f"Message: {message.content}")
            elif message.tool_calls:
                print(f"Tool calls: {message.tool_calls}")
            print("---" * 5, "Metrics", "---" * 5)
            pprint(message.metrics.to_dict())
            print("---" * 20)

# Print the aggregated metrics for the whole run
print("---" * 5, "Run Metrics", "---" * 5)
pprint(run_response.metrics.to_dict())
# Print the aggregated metrics for the whole session
print("---" * 5, "Session Metrics", "---" * 5)
pprint(agent.get_session_metrics().to_dict())
```

You'll see the outputs with following information:

- `input_tokens`: The number of tokens sent to the model.
- `output_tokens`: The number of tokens received from the model.
- `total_tokens`: The sum of `input_tokens` and `output_tokens`.
- `audio_input_tokens`: The number of tokens sent to the model for audio input.
- `audio_output_tokens`: The number of tokens received from the model for audio output.
- `audio_total_tokens`: The sum of `audio_input_tokens` and `audio_output_tokens`.
- `cache_read_tokens`: The number of tokens read from the cache.
- `cache_write_tokens`: The number of tokens written to the cache.
- `reasoning_tokens`: The number of tokens used for reasoning.
- `duration`: The duration of the run in seconds.
- `time_to_first_token`: The time taken until the first token was generated.
- `provider_metrics`: Any provider-specific metrics.
