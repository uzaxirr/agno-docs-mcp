When you call `Agent.run()`, it creates a single, stateless interaction. The agent responds to your message and that's it - no memory of what just happened.

But most real applications need **conversations**, not just one-off exchanges. That's where sessions come in.

## What's a Session?

Think of a session as a conversation thread. It's a collection of back-and-forth interactions (called "runs") between a user and your Agent, Team, or Workflow. Each session gets a unique `session_id` that ties together all the runs, chat history, state, and metrics for that conversation.

Here's the breakdown:

- **Session**: A multi-turn conversation identified by a `session_id`. Contains all the runs, history, state, and metrics for that conversation thread.
- **Run**: A single interaction within a session. Every time you call `Agent.run()`, `Team.run()`, or `Workflow.run()`, a new `run_id` is created. Think of it as one message-and-response pair in the conversation.

<Note>
Sessions require a database to store history and state. See [Session Storage](/basics/database/overview) for setup details.
</Note>

<Note>
**Workflow sessions work differently:** Unlike agent and team sessions that store conversation messages, workflow sessions track complete pipeline executions (runs) with inputs and outputs. Because of these unique characteristics, we've created a [dedicated Workflow Sessions section](/basics/sessions/workflow-sessions) that covers workflow-specific features like run-based history, session state, and workflow agents.

## Single-Run Example

When you run an agent without specifying a `session_id`, Agno automatically generates both a `run_id` and a `session_id` for you:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"))

# Run the agent - Agno auto-generates session_id and run_id
response = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")
print(response.content)
print(f"Run ID: {response.run_id}")        # Auto-generated UUID
print(f"Session ID: {response.session_id}") # Auto-generated UUID
```

This creates a new session with a single run. But here's the catch: without a database configured, there's no persistence. The `session_id` exists for this single run, but you can't continue the conversation later because nothing is saved. To actually use sessions for multi-turn conversations, you need to configure a database (even an `InMemoryDb` works).

## Multi-User Conversations

In production, multiple users often talk to the same agent or team simultaneously. Sessions keep those threads isolated:

- `user_id` distinguishes the person using your product.
- `session_id` distinguishes conversation threads for that user (think "chat tabs").
- Conversation history only flows into the run when you enable it via [`add_history_to_context`](/basics/chat-history/agent/overview#add-history-to-the-agent-context).

For a full walkthrough that includes persistence, history, and per-user session IDs, follow the [Persisting Sessions guide](/basics/sessions/persisting-sessions#multi-user-sessions) or the [Chat History cookbook example](/examples/basics/agent/session/05_chat_history).
