This example demonstrates how to enable agentic session state in teams and agents, allowing them to automatically manage and update their session state during interactions. The agents can modify the session state autonomously based on the conversation context.

<Steps>

    <Step title="Create a Python file">
        Create a file `agentic_session_state.py`
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add code to file">
        ```python agentic_session_state.py
        from agno.agent import Agent
        from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
        from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
        from agno.team.team import Team

        db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db")
        shopping_agent = Agent(
            name="Shopping List Agent",
            role="Manage the shopping list",
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
            db=db,
            add_session_state_to_context=True,  # Required so the agent is aware of the session state
            enable_agentic_state=True,
        )

        team = Team(
            members=[shopping_agent],
            session_state={"shopping_list": []},
            db=db,
            add_session_state_to_context=True,  # Required so the team is aware of the session state
            enable_agentic_state=True,
            description="You are a team that manages a shopping list and chores",
            show_members_responses=True,
        )


        team.print_response("Add milk, eggs, and bread to the shopping list")

        team.print_response("I picked up the eggs, now what's on my list?")

        print(f"Session state: {team.get_session_state()}")
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Install libraries">
        ```bash
        pip install agno openai
        ```
    </Step>

    <Snippet file="set-openai-key.mdx" />

    <Step title="Run the team">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Mac
        python agentic_session_state.py
        ```

        ```bash Windows
        python agentic_session_state.py
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
