This example demonstrates how to use session state variables directly in team instructions using template syntax. The session state values are automatically injected into the instructions, making them available to the team during execution.

<Steps>

    <Step title="Create a Python file">
        Create a file `session_state_in_instructions.py`
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add code to file">
        ```python session_state_in_instructions.py
        from agno.team.team import Team

        team = Team(
            members=[],
            # Initialize the session state with a variable
            session_state={"user_name": "John"},
            instructions="Users name is {user_name}",
            markdown=True,
        )

        team.print_response("What is my name?", stream=True)
        ```
    </Step>

    <Snippet file="create-venv-step.mdx" />

    <Step title="Install libraries">
        ```bash
        pip install agno openai
        ```
    </Step>

    <Snippet file="set-openai-key.mdx" />

    <Step title="Run the team">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Mac
        python session_state_in_instructions.py
        ```

        ```bash Windows
        python session_state_in_instructions.py
        ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
