This example demonstrates how to enable sharing of member interactions within a team. When `share_member_interactions` is set to True, team members can see and build upon each other's responses, creating a collaborative workflow.

<Steps>

    <Step title="Create a Python file">
        Create a file `share_member_interactions.py`
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add code to file">
        ```python share_member_interactions.py
        from agno.agent.agent import Agent
        from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
        from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
        from agno.team.team import Team
        from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

        db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agents.db")

        web_research_agent = Agent(
            name="Web Research Agent",
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
            tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
            instructions="You are a web research agent that can answer questions from the web.",
        )

        report_agent = Agent(
            name="Report Agent",
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
            instructions="You are a report agent that can write a report from the web research.",
        )

        team = Team(
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
            db=db,
            members=[web_research_agent, report_agent],
            share_member_interactions=True,
            instructions=[
                "You are a team of agents that can research the web and write a report.",
                "First, research the web for information about the topic.",
                "Then, use your report agent to write a report from the web research.",
            ],
            show_members_responses=True,
            debug_mode=True,
        )

        team.print_response("How are LEDs made?")
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Install libraries">
        ```bash
        pip install agno openai ddgs
        ```
    </Step>

    <Snippet file="set-openai-key.mdx" />

    <Step title="Run the team">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Mac
        python share_member_interactions.py
        ```

        ```bash Windows
        python share_member_interactions.py
        ```
