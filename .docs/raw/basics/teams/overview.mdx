A Team is a collection of Agents (or other sub-teams) that work together to accomplish tasks.

A `Team` has a list of `members` that can be instances of either `Agent` or `Team`.

A team can be visualized as a tree structure, where the team leader delegates tasks to sub-teams or directly to agents. The top level of the `Team` is called the "team leader".

Below is a minimal example of a language-routing team with two agents and one sub-team.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent

team = Team(members=[
    Agent(name="English Agent", role="You answer questions in English"),
    Agent(name="Chinese Agent", role="You answer questions in Chinese"),
    Team(
      name="Germanic Team", 
      role="You coordinate the team members to answer questions in German and Dutch",
      members=[
        Agent(name="German Agent", role="You answer questions in German"),
        Agent(name="Dutch Agent", role="You answer questions in Dutch"),
      ],
    ),
])
```

<Note>

It is highly recommended to first learn more about [Agents](/basics/agents/overview) before diving into Teams.
</Note>

The team leader delegates tasks to members depending on the role of the members and the nature of the tasks.  See the [Delegation](/basics/teams/delegation) guide for more details.

As with agents, teams support the following features:

- **Model:** Set the model that is used by the "team leader" to delegate tasks to the team members.
- **Instructions:** Instruct the team leader on how to solve problems. The names, descriptions and roles of team members are automatically provided to the team leader.
- **Database:** The Team's session history and state is stored in a database. This enables your team to continue conversations from where they left off, enabling multi-turn, long-running conversations.
- **Reasoning:** Enables the team leader to "think" before responding or delegating tasks to team members, and "analyze" the results of team members' responses.
- **Knowledge:** If the team needs to search for information, you can add a knowledge base to the team. This is accessible to the team leader.
- **Memory:** Gives Teams the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.
- **Tools:** If the team leader needs to be able to use tools directly, you can add tools to the team.

<Note>
If you are migrating from Agno v1.x.x, the `mode` parameter has been deprecated. Please see the [Migration Guide](/how-to/v2-migration#teams) for more details on how to migrate your teams.

## When should you use Teams?

When should you use Teams?

The general guideline is to have Agents that are narrow in scope. When you have a complex task that requires a variety of tools or a long list of steps, a Team of single-purpose agents would be a good fit.

In addition, if a single agent's context limit gets easily exceeded, because of the complexity of the task, a Team would address this by keeping a single agent's context small, becaues it only addresses a part of the task.
