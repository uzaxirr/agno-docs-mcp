description: This example demonstrates a simple team of AI agents working together to research topics across different platforms.
---

The team consists of three specialized agents:
1. **HackerNews Researcher** - Uses HackerNews API to find and analyze relevant HackerNews posts
2. **Article Reader** - Reads articles from URLs

The team leader coordinates the agents by:
- Giving each agent a specific task
- Providing clear instructions for each agent
- Collecting and summarizing the results from each agent



<Steps>

  <Step title="Create a Python file">
    ```bash
    touch basic_team.py
    ```
  </Step>


  <Step title="Add the following code to your Python file">

    ```python basic_team.py
    from typing import List

    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


    class Article(BaseModel):
        title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the article")
        summary: str = Field(..., description="A summary of the article")
        reference_links: List[str] = Field(
            ..., description="A list of reference links to the article"
        )


    hn_researcher = Agent(
        name="HackerNews Researcher",
        model=OpenAIChat("gpt-5-mini"),
        role="Gets top stories from hackernews.",

        members=[hn_researcher, article_reader],
        instructions=[
            "First, search hackernews for what the user is asking about.",
            "Then, ask the article reader to read the links for the stories to get more information.",
            "Important: you must provide the article reader with the links to read.",
            "Then, ask the web searcher to search for each story to get more information.",
            "Finally, provide a thoughtful and engaging summary.",

        input="Write an article about the top 2 stories on hackernews", stream=True
    )
