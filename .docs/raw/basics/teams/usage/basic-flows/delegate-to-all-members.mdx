title: Delegate to All Members (Cooperation)
sidebarTitle: Delegate to All Members
description: This example demonstrates a collaborative team of AI agents working together to research topics across different platforms.
---

The team consists of two specialized agents:
1. **Reddit Researcher** - Uses DuckDuckGo to find and analyze relevant Reddit posts
2. **HackerNews Researcher** - Uses HackerNews API to find and analyze relevant HackerNews posts

The agents work in a collaborative mode by using `delegate_to_all_members=True`, meaning they:
- Both are given the same task at the same time
- Work towards reaching consensus through discussion
- Are coordinated by a team leader that guides the discussion

The team leader moderates the discussion and determines when consensus is reached.
