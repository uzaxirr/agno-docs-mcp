title: Model Inheritance
sidebarTitle: Members Inherit Model
description: This example demonstrates how agents automatically inherit the model from their parent team.
---

**When the Team has a model:**
- Agents without a model use the Team's `model`
- Agents with their own model keep their own model
- In nested teams, agents use the `model` from their direct parent team
- The `reasoning_model`, `parser_model`, and `output_model` must be set explicitly on each team member or team

**When the Team has no model:**
- The Team and all agents default to OpenAI `gpt-4o`

        instructions=["Be thorough and detailed"],
    )

    writer = Agent(
        name="Writer",
        role="Write content based on research",
        instructions=["Write clearly and concisely"],
