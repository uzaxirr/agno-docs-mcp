Agno Workflows enable you to build deterministic, controlled agentic flows by orchestrating agents, teams, and functions through a series of defined steps. Unlike free-form agent interactions, workflows provide structured automation with predictable execution patterns, making them ideal for production systems that require reliable, repeatable processes.

Each step in a workflow handles a specific part of a larger task, with output automatically flowing from one step to the next, creating a smooth pipeline from start to finish. Think of it like an assembly line: each step specializes in one thing, and together they accomplish complex tasks that would be hard for a single agent or team to handle.

## Your First Workflow

Here's a simple workflow that takes a topic, researches it, and writes an article:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.workflow import Workflow
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Define agents with specific roles
researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="Find relevant information about the topic",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="Write a clear, engaging article based on the research"
)

# Chain them together in a workflow
content_workflow = Workflow(
    name="Content Creation",
    steps=[researcher, writer]
)

# Run the workflow
content_workflow.print_response("Write an article about climate change solutions", stream=True)
```

That's it! The workflow automatically:
1. Passes your input to the researcher
2. Takes the research results and feeds them to the writer
3. Returns the final article

## Why should you use Workflows?

Workflows provide deterministic control over your agentic systems, enabling you to build reliable automation that executes consistently every time. They're essential when you need:

**Deterministic Execution**

- Predictable step-by-step processing with defined inputs and outputs
- Consistent results across multiple runs
- Clear audit trails for production systems

**Complex Orchestration**

- Multi-agent coordination with controlled handoffs
- Parallel processing and conditional branching
- Loop structures for iterative tasks

Workflows excel at **deterministic agent automation**, while [Teams](/basics/teams/overview) are designed for **dynamic agentic coordination**. Use workflows when you need predictable, repeatable processes; use teams when you need flexible, collaborative problem-solving.

## What Can Be a Step?

Each step in your workflow can be:

- **An Agent** - Individual AI executors with specific capabilities and instructions
- **A Team** - Coordinated groups of agents working together on complex problems
- **A Function** - Custom Python functions for specialized processing logic

<Note>
Your agents and teams retain their individual characteristics and capabilities, but now operate within a structured framework that ensures:

- **Predictable execution**: Steps run in defined order with controlled inputs/outputs
- **Repeatable results**: Same inputs produce consistent outputs across runs
- **Clear data flow**: Output from each step explicitly becomes input for the next
- **Controlled state**: Session management and state persistence between steps
- **Reliable error handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error recovery
</Note>

## Controlling Workflows

Once comfortable with basic workflows, you can add:

- **Conditional Logic** - Different paths based on results
- **Parallel Execution** - Run multiple steps at the same time
- **Loops** - Repeat steps until a condition is met
- **Conversational Workflows** - When users interact directly with your workflow (rather than calling it programmatically), you can make it **conversational** by adding a `WorkflowAgent`. This enables natural chat-like interactions where the workflow intelligently decides whether to answer from previous results or execute new workflow runs.
