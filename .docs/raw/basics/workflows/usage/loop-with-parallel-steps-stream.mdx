title: Loop with Parallel Steps Workflow
description: This example demonstrates **Workflows 2.0** most sophisticated pattern combining loop execution with parallel processing and real-time streaming.
---

This example shows how to create iterative
workflows that execute multiple independent tasks simultaneously within each iteration,
optimizing both quality and performance.

**When to use**: When you need iterative quality improvement with parallel task execution
in each iteration. Ideal for comprehensive research workflows where multiple independent
tasks contribute to overall quality, and you need to repeat until quality thresholds are met.
