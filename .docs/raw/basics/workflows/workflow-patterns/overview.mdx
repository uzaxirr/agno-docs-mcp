description: Master deterministic workflow patterns including sequential, parallel, conditional, and looping execution for reliable multi-agent automation.
---

Build deterministic, production-ready workflows that orchestrate agents, teams, and functions with predictable execution patterns. This comprehensive guide covers all workflow types, from simple sequential processes to complex branching logic with parallel execution and dynamic routing.

Unlike free-form agent interactions, these patterns provide structured automation with consistent, repeatable results ideal for production systems.

## Building Blocks

The core building blocks of Agno Workflows are:

| Component     | Purpose                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Step**      | Basic execution unit            |
| **Agent**     | AI assistant with specific role |
| **Team**      | Coordinated group of agents     |
| **Function**  | Custom Python logic             |
| **Parallel**  | Concurrent execution            |
| **Condition** | Conditional execution           |
| **Loop**      | Iterative execution             |
| **Router**    | Dynamic routing                 |


Agno Workflows support multiple execution patterns that can be combined to build sophisticated automation systems. 
Each pattern serves specific use cases and can be composed together for complex workflows.
