title: Competitor Analysis Agent
mode: wide
---

Build an AI agent that performs comprehensive competitive intelligence by combining web search, content scraping, and reasoning tools to analyze competitors and generate strategic reports with actionable insights.

## What You'll Learn

By building this agent, you'll understand:
- How to integrate multiple tools (Firecrawl and ReasoningTools) for complex workflows
- How to structure multi-phase research processes with clear instructions
- How reasoning tools make the agent's analytical thinking transparent
- How to define structured output templates for consistent reports

## Use Cases

Build market research tools, competitive intelligence systems, strategic planning assistants, or due diligence platforms for investment decisions.

## How It Works

The agent follows a systematic five-phase research process:

1. **Discovery**: Finds competitors and industry information using web search
2. **Analysis**: Scrapes websites and extracts detailed information
3. **Comparison**: Analyzes features and competitive positioning
4. **Synthesis**: Conducts SWOT analysis with reasoning tools
5. **Reporting**: Compiles findings into actionable recommendations

Reasoning tools provide transparency into the agent's analytical thinking throughout the process.

## What to Expect

The agent will conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis in five phases. It uses Firecrawl to search for competitors and scrape their websites, then applies reasoning tools to analyze findings. The analysis streams in real-time so you can follow the agent's research and thinking process.

The final output is a detailed strategic report with competitor profiles, SWOT analyses, comparative tables, and actionable recommendations organized by timeline (immediate, short-term, long-term).
