Build an AI research agent that combines web search with professional journalism to perform comprehensive research, fact-check information, and deliver well-structured NYT-style articles.

## What You'll Learn

By building this agent, you'll understand:
- How to use web search tools (DuckDuckGo) for multi-source research
- How to extract and analyze content from web articles using Newspaper4k
- How to structure professional journalistic writing with clear instructions
- How to define output templates for consistent article formatting

## Use Cases

Build investigative journalism tools, research report generators, fact-checking systems, or content analysis platforms.

## How It Works

The agent follows a professional journalism research workflow:

1. **Research**: Searches 10+ authoritative sources using DuckDuckGo
2. **Extract**: Uses Newspaper4k to pull content from relevant articles
3. **Analyze**: Cross-references facts, identifies patterns and trends
4. **Write**: Structures findings into NYT-style articles with balanced perspectives
5. **Verify**: Ensures all facts and attributions are accurate

The agent maintains journalistic standards of objectivity and includes proper sourcing throughout.
