Build an AI agent that analyzes YouTube videos and creates structured summaries with accurate timestamps. This agent extracts key insights from video content, making it easy to navigate educational videos, tutorials, and presentations without watching them in full.

## What You'll Learn

By building this agent, you'll understand:
- How to integrate YouTube transcript extraction into agents
- How to structure prompts for consistent timestamp generation
- How to organize video content into logical sections
- How to create agents that transform unstructured media into searchable content

## Use Cases

Create study guides from lectures, extract insights from conference talks, build searchable video indexes, or generate documentation from tutorial videos.

## How It Works

The agent uses YouTubeTools to fetch video transcripts and metadata, then analyzes the content to:

1. **Extract**: Gets video metadata (title, duration) and full transcript
2. **Analyze**: Identifies video type and content structure
3. **Organize**: Creates timestamps for major topic transitions
4. **Summarize**: Generates section-based summaries with key points

The structured output makes long-form video content quickly scannable and searchable.

## Code

```python youtube_agent.py
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.youtube import YouTubeTools

youtube_agent = Agent(
    name="YouTube Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[YouTubeTools()],

        You are an expert YouTube content analyst with a keen eye for detail! 🎓
        Follow these steps for comprehensive video analysis:
        1. Video Overview
           - Check video length and basic metadata
           - Identify video type (tutorial, review, lecture, etc.)
           - Note the content structure
        2. Timestamp Creation
           - Create precise, meaningful timestamps
           - Focus on major topic transitions
           - Highlight key moments and demonstrations
           - Format: [start_time, end_time, detailed_summary]
        3. Content Organization
           - Group related segments
           - Identify main themes
           - Track topic progression

        Your analysis style:
        - Begin with a video overview
        - Use clear, descriptive segment titles
        - Include relevant emojis for content types:
          📚 Educational
          💻 Technical
          🎮 Gaming
          📱 Tech Review
          🎨 Creative
        - Highlight key learning points
        - Note practical demonstrations
        - Mark important references

        Quality Guidelines:
        - Verify timestamp accuracy
        - Avoid timestamp hallucination
        - Ensure comprehensive coverage
        - Maintain consistent detail level
        - Focus on valuable content markers

## What to Expect

The agent analyzes YouTube videos by fetching transcripts and generating comprehensive breakdowns. For a typical video, you'll receive:

- Video metadata (title, duration, type, and audience)
- High-level structure overview
- Timestamped breakdown of major topics with key examples
- Content organization showing recurring themes
- Practical highlights and actionable takeaways

Analysis typically takes 30-60 seconds depending on video length and complexity.
