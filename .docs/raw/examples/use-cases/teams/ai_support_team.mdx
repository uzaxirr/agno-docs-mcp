Build an intelligent customer support team that routes inquiries to specialized agents for documentation search, issue escalation, and feedback collection. This example demonstrates advanced routing with knowledge bases and external integrations.

## What You'll Learn

By building this team, you'll understand:
- How to create a routing system that classifies and directs customer inquiries
- How to integrate knowledge bases with vector search for documentation assistance
- How to connect external tools like Slack for escalation and feedback workflows
- How to combine multiple specialized agents with distinct responsibilities

## Use Cases

Build customer support platforms, help desk systems, technical documentation assistants, or automated ticketing systems.

## How It Works

The team uses intelligent routing to direct inquiries to specialized agents:

1. **Classify**: Team leader analyzes the inquiry type (question, bug, feedback)
2. **Route**: Directs to appropriate agent based on classification
3. **Process**: Specialized agent handles the inquiry with their tools
4. **Integrate**: Connects with external systems (Slack, knowledge base)
5. **Respond**: Provides professional response back to the user

Each agent has specific tools and instructions for their domain of responsibility.

## What to Expect

The team will analyze your inquiry and route it to the most appropriate agent. Documentation questions get answered by searching the knowledge base, bugs get escalated to Slack, and feedback gets collected and logged.

You'll see the team's classification decision and responses from the specific agents handling your request. The knowledge base integration enables accurate answers grounded in actual documentation, while Slack integration provides seamless escalation workflows.
