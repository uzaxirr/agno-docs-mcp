title: Company Description Workflow
mode: wide
---

Build a comprehensive supplier profile generator that combines web crawling, search engines, Wikipedia, and competitor analysis. This workflow processes company information through specialized agents and delivers detailed markdown reports via email.

## What You'll Learn

By building this workflow, you'll understand:
- How to coordinate multiple agents running in parallel for data gathering
- How to integrate diverse data sources (web crawling, search, Wikipedia)
- How to implement workflow session state caching for expensive operations
- How to automate report generation and email delivery with Resend

## Use Cases

Build supplier research platforms, company intelligence systems, vendor evaluation tools, or automated due diligence reports.

## How It Works

The workflow coordinates four specialized agents running in parallel:

1. **Crawl**: Crawler agent uses Firecrawl to extract information from the company website
2. **Search**: Search agent uses DuckDuckGo to find recent news and articles
3. **Research**: Wikipedia agent gathers background and historical information
4. **Analyze**: Competitor agent identifies and analyzes market competitors
5. **Synthesize**: Profile agent combines all findings into a structured markdown report
6. **Deliver**: Report is automatically sent via email using Resend

The workflow caches analysis results in session state - subsequent requests for the same supplier return cached data.
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-key"
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-firecrawl-key"
```

Install dependencies
```
pip install agno openai firecrawl-py resend
```

## Code Structure

This company description workflow consists of three main files:

### 1. Agents (`agents.py`)

Specialized agents for gathering information from multiple sources:

```python agents.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.firecrawl import FirecrawlTools

    SUPPLIER_PROFILE_INSTRUCTIONS_GENERAL,
    WIKIPEDIA_INSTRUCTIONS,
)
from pydantic import BaseModel


class SupplierProfile(BaseModel):
    supplier_name: str

```

### 2. Prompts (`prompts.py`)

"""

SUPPLIER_PROFILE_INSTRUCTIONS_GENERAL = """
You are a supplier profile agent. You are given a supplier name, results from the supplier homepage and search results regarding the supplier, and Wikipedia results regarding the supplier. You need to be extremely verbose in your response. Do not filter out any content.

You are tasked with generating a segment of a supplier profile. The segment will be provided to you. Make sure to format it in markdown.

General format:

Title: [Title of the segment]

[Segment]

Formatting Guidelines:
1. Ensure the profile is structured, clear, and to the point.
2. Avoid assumptions—only include verified details.
3. Use bullet points and short paragraphs for readability.
4. Cite sources where applicable for credibility.

Objective: This supplier profile should serve as a reliable reference document for businesses evaluating potential suppliers. The details should be extracted from official sources, search results, and any other reputable databases. The profile must provide an in-depth understanding of the supplier's operational, competitive, and financial position to support informed decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Four agents gather information simultaneously for maximum efficiency
- **Multi-Source Data**: Combines web crawling, search engines, Wikipedia, and competitor analysis
- **Email Integration**: Automatically sends formatted reports via email using Resend
- **Markdown Formatting**: Generates structured, readable reports in HTML format
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of agents, prompts, and workflow logic
- **Efficient Execution**: Uses parallel steps to minimize execution time
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models for structured data validation

## Usage Example

```python
# Create supplier profile request
supplier_request = SupplierProfile(
    supplier_name="Your Company Name",
    supplier_homepage_url="https://yourcompany.com",
    user_email="your.email@company.com",
)

# Run the workflow
company_description_workflow.print_response(
    input=supplier_request,
)
```

## What to Expect

The workflow will simultaneously gather information from multiple sources (website crawling, web search, Wikipedia, competitor analysis) then generate a comprehensive supplier profile. You'll see progress indicators for each agent's data collection.

The final output is a structured markdown report delivered via email. The workflow caches all analysis results - if you request the same supplier again, it returns the cached profile instantly instead of re-running the expensive analysis pipeline.
