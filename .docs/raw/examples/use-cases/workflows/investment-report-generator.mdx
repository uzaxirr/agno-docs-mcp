Build a sophisticated investment analysis system that combines market research, financial analysis, and portfolio management. This workflow analyzes stocks, evaluates investment potential, and generates strategic portfolio allocation recommendations.

## What You'll Learn

By building this workflow, you'll understand:
- How to structure multi-stage financial analysis workflows
- How to integrate web search for real-time market research
- How to rank and compare investment opportunities systematically
- How to generate comprehensive investment reports with rationale

## Use Cases

Build investment research platforms, portfolio analysis tools, financial advisory systems, or automated stock screening applications.

## How It Works

The workflow follows a three-stage investment analysis process:

1. **Research**: Market analyst agent uses DuckDuckGo to gather comprehensive information on each stock
2. **Evaluate**: Investment analyst ranks stocks by potential and provides detailed rationale
3. **Allocate**: Portfolio manager creates strategic allocation recommendations based on rankings
4. **Report**: Generates a professional investment report with analysis and recommendations

The workflow processes multiple stocks simultaneously and provides comparative analysis.

## Code

```python investment_report_generator.py
"""Investment Report Generator - Your AI Financial Analysis Studio!

This advanced example demonstrates how to build a sophisticated investment analysis system that combines
market research, financial analysis, and portfolio management. The workflow uses a three-stage
approach:
1. Comprehensive stock analysis and market research
2. Investment potential evaluation and ranking
3. Strategic portfolio allocation recommendations

Key capabilities:
- Real-time market data analysis
- Professional financial research
- Investment risk assessment
- Portfolio allocation strategy
- Detailed investment rationale

Example companies to analyze:
- "AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL" (Tech Giants)
- "NVDA, AMD, INTC" (Semiconductor Leaders)
- "TSLA, F, GM" (Automotive Innovation)
- "JPM, BAC, GS" (Banking Sector)
- "AMZN, WMT, TGT" (Retail Competition)
- "PFE, JNJ, MRNA" (Healthcare Focus)
- "XOM, CVX, BP" (Energy Sector)

## What to Expect

The workflow analyzes multiple stocks through three phases: market research, investment evaluation, and portfolio allocation. You'll see research findings for each stock, comparative rankings with investment rationale, and strategic allocation recommendations.

The final output is a comprehensive investment report with detailed analysis of each stock, risk assessment, and portfolio allocation strategy based on systematic evaluation criteria.
