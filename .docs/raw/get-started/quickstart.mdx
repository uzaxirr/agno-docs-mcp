## Build your first Agent

**Agents are AI programs where a language model controls the flow of execution.**

Instead of a toy demo, let's build an Agent that you can extend by connecting to any MCP server. We'll connect our agent to the Agno MCP server, and give it a database to store conversation history and state.

Save the following code in a file named `agno_agent.py`

```python agno_agent.py lines
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

# Create the Agent
agno_agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    # Add a database to the Agent
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    # Add the Agno MCP server to the Agent
    tools=[MCPTools(transport="streamable-http", url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    # Add the previous session history to the context
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)


# Create the AgentOS
agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agno_agent])
# Get the FastAPI app for the AgentOS
app = agent_os.get_app()
```

<Check>

There is an incredible amount of alpha in these 25 lines of code.

You get a fully functional Agent with memory and state that can access any MCP server. It's served via a FastAPI app with pre-built endpoints that you can use to build your product.

## Run your AgentOS

The AgentOS gives us a FastAPI application with ready-to-use API endpoints. Let's run it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup your virtual environment">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    uv venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    uv venv --python 3.12
    .venv/Scripts/activate
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    uv pip install -U agno anthropic mcp 'fastapi[standard]' sqlalchemy
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    uv pip install -U agno anthropic mcp 'fastapi[standard]' sqlalchemy
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Export your Anthropic API key">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-***
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sk-***
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your AgentOS">

    ```shell
    fastapi dev agno_agent.py
    ```

    This will start your AgentOS on `http://localhost:8000`

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect your AgentOS

Agno provides a beautiful web interface that connects directly to your AgentOS, use it to monitor, manage and test your agentic system. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) and sign in to your account.

- Click on **"Add new OS"** in the top navigation bar.
- Select **"Local"** to connect to a local AgentOS running on your machine.
- Enter the endpoint URL of your AgentOS. The default is `http://localhost:8000`.
- Give your AgentOS a descriptive name like "Development OS" or "Local 8000".
- Click **"Connect"**.

Once connected, you'll see your new OS with a live status indicator.

## Chat with your Agent

Next, let's chat with our Agent, go to the `Chat` section in the sidebar and select your Agent.

- Ask “What is Agno?” and the Agent will answer using the Agno MCP server.
- Agents keep their own history, tools, and instructions; switching users won’t mix context.

<Tip>

Click on Sessions to view your Agent's conversations. This data is stored in your Agent's database, so no need for external tracing services.

</Tip>

## Pre-built API endpoints

The FastAPI app generated by your AgentOS comes with pre-built SSE-compatible API endpoints that you can build your product on top of. You can add your own routes, middleware or any other FastAPI feature.

Checkout the API endpoints at `/docs` of your AgentOS url, e.g. http://localhost:8000/docs
