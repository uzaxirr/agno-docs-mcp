description: Use .cursorrules to improve AI coding assistant suggestions when building agents with Agno
---

A [`.cursorrules`](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) file teaches AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Windsurf) how to build better agents with Agno.

## What is .cursorrules?

`.cursorrules` is a configuration file that provides your AI coding assistant with instructions on how to generate specific code.
Agno's recommended `.cursorrules` file contains:
- Agno-specific patterns and best practices
- Correct parameter names and syntax
- Common mistakes to avoid
- When to use Agent vs Team vs Workflow

Think of it as a reference guide that helps your AI assistant build agents correctly with Agno.

## Why Use It?

Without `.cursorrules`, AI assistants might suggest:
- Wrong parameter names (like `agents=` instead of `members=` for Teams)
- Outdated patterns or incorrect syntax
- Performance anti-patterns (creating agents in loops)
- Non-existent methods or features

With `.cursorrules`, your AI will:
- Suggest correct Agno patterns automatically
- Follow performance best practices
- Use the right approach for your use case
- Catch common mistakes before you make them

## How to Use .cursorrules

Copy the Agno `.cursorrules` file to your project root:

```bash
# Download the .cursorrules file
curl -o .cursorrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agno-agi/agno/main/.cursorrules

# Or clone and copy
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agno.git
cp agno/.cursorrules /path/to/your/project/
```

Your AI assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) will automatically detect and use it.
