<img height="200" src="/images/changelogs/agent_os_stack.png" />

This is a major release that introduces a completely new approach to building multi-agent systems. It also introduces the AgentOS, a runtime for agents.

This is a major rewrite of the Agno library and introduces various new concepts and updates to the existing ones.

Some of the major changes are:

- Agents, Teams and Workflows are now fully stateless.
- Knowledge is now a single solution that supports many forms of content.
- Storage of sessions, memories, evals, etc. has been simplified

## General Changes

<Accordion title="Repo Updates">
  - `/libs/agno` has been restructured to fit the new concepts in Agno and for better organization.
  - All code related to managing workspaces and agent deployment in Agno has been moved to a new package called `agno-infra`. This is a combination of the previous `agno-aws` and `agno-docker` packages, as well as the CLI and other tools.
  - `agno-aws` and `agno-docker` packages have been deprecated and will no-longer be maintained.
  - All code related to the Agno CLI (`ag`) has been moved to this new `agno-infra` package.
  - Added `AgentOS` to `agno` as a comprehensive API solution for building multi-agent systems. This also replaces `Playground` and other Apps. See details below.
  - Cookbook has been completely restructured, with new and more valuable READMEs, better coverage of concepts, and more examples.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AgentOS">
  - Introducing `AgentOS`, a system for hosting agents, teams and workflows as a production-ready API. See full details in the [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction) section.
  - This adds routes for session management, memory management, knowledge management, evals management, and metrics.
  - This enables you to host agents, teams and workflows, and use the [Agent OS UI](https://os.agno.com) to manage them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Apps Deprecations">
  - Removed `Playground`. Its functionality has been replaced by `AgentOS`.
  - Removed `AGUIApp` and replace with `AGUI` interface on `AgentOS`.
  - Removed `SlackApi` and replace with `Slack` interface on `AgentOS`.
  - Removed `WhatsappApi` and replace with `Whatsapp` interface on `AgentOS`.
  - Removed `FastAPIApp`. Its functionality has been replaced by `AgentOS`.
  - `DiscordClient` has been moved to `/integrations/discord`.
</Accordion>

## Session & Run State

- We have made significant changes to the innerworkings of `Agent`, `Team` and `Workflow` to make them completely stateless.
- This means that `agent_session`, `session_metrics`, `session_state`, etc. should not be seen as stateful variables that would be updated during the course of a run, but rather as "defaults" for the agent if they can be set on initialisation.
- `CustomEvent` is now supported and you can inherit from it to create your own custom events that can be yielded from your own tools. See the [documentation](/basics/agents/running-agents#custom-events) for more details.

<Accordion title="Updates to Run Objects">
  For agents:
  - `RunResponse` -> `RunOutput`
  - `RunResponseStartedEvent` -> `RunStartedEvent`
  - `RunResponseContentEvent` -> `RunContentEvent`
  - `RunResponseCompletedEvent` -> `RunCompletedEvent`
  - `IntermediateRunResponseContentEvent` -> `IntermediateRunContentEvent`
  - `RunResponseErrorEvent` -> `RunErrorEvent`
  - `RunResponseCancelledEvent` -> `RunCancelledEvent`

  For teams:
  - `TeamRunResponse` -> `TeamRunOutput`
  - `RunResponseStartedEvent` -> `RunStartedEvent`
  - `RunResponseContentEvent` -> `RunContentEvent`
  - `RunResponseCompletedEvent` -> `RunCompletedEvent`
  - `IntermediateRunResponseContentEvent` -> `IntermediateRunContentEvent`
  - `RunResponseErrorEvent` -> `RunErrorEvent`
  - `RunResponseCancelledEvent` -> `RunCancelledEvent`

  For workflows:
  - `WorkflowRunResponse` -> `WorkflowRunOutput`
  - `WorkflowRunResponseStartedEvent` -> `WorkflowRunStartedEvent`
  - `WorkflowRunResponseContentEvent` -> `WorkflowRunContentEvent`
  - `WorkflowRunResponseCompletedEvent` -> `WorkflowRunCompletedEvent`
  - `WorkflowRunResponseErrorEvent` -> `WorkflowRunErrorEvent`
  - `WorkflowRunResponseCancelledEvent` -> `WorkflowRunCancelledEvent`

  - The import location for `RunOutput` (and events) has been moved to `agno.run.agent`.
  - For `RunOutput`, `TeamRunOutput` and `WorkflowRunOutput` the `extra_data` attribute has been removed and the internal attributes are now top-level. This is `references`, `additional_input`, `reasoning_steps`, and `reasoning_messages`.
  - `metadata` added to `RunOutput`, `TeamRunOutput` and `WorkflowRunOutput`. This represents all the set metadata for the run.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Updates to Session Objects">
  - Session storage now stores `AgentSession`, `TeamSession` and `WorkflowSession` with new schemas. See full details in the [Session](/basics/sessions/overview) section.
  - Session objects now have `runs` directly on it.
  - Session objects support new convenience methods:
    - `get_run` -> Get a specific run by ID.
    - `get_session_summary` -> Get the session summary.
    - `get_chat_history` -> Get an aggregated view of all messages for all runs in the session.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Updates to Metrics">
  - `SessionMetrics` and `MessageMetrics` have been unified as a single `Metrics` class.
  - `audio_tokens` has been renamed to `audio_total_tokens`.
  - `input_audio_tokens` has been renamed to `audio_input_tokens`.
  - `output_audio_tokens` has been renamed to `audio_output_tokens`.
  - `cached_tokens` has been renamed to `cache_read_tokens`.
  - `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens` have been removed (only `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` should be used)
  - `prompt_tokens_details` and `completion_tokens_details` have been removed. Instead `provider_metrics` captures any provider-specific metrics.
  - `time` has been renamed to `duration`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cancelling Runs">
  - You can now cancel a run by calling `cancel_run` on the `Agent`, `Team` or `Workflow`.
  - This will cancel the run and return a `RunCancelledEvent` during streaming, or set the `RunOutput.status` to `"cancelled"`.
</Accordion>


## Storage

- `Agent`, `Team`, `Workflow` and the various evals now all support a single `db` parameter. This is to enable storage for the instance of that class. This is required for persistence of sessions, memories, metrics, etc.
- `storage` and `memory` have been removed from `Agent`, `Team` and `Workflow`.

<Accordion title="Updates to Storage Classes">
  - This means all previous storage providers have been reworked. Also session storage, memory storage and eval storage are all a single solution now referred to as a "DB".
  - `PostgresStorage` -> `PostgresDb`
  - `SqliteStorage` -> `SqliteDb`
  - `MysqlStorage` -> `MysqlDb`
  - `RedisStorage` -> `RedisDb`
  - `MongoStorage` -> `MongoDb`
  - `DynamoDBStorage` -> `DynamoDb`
  - `SingleStoreStorage` -> `SingleStoreDb`
  - `InMemoryStorage` -> `InMemoryDb`
  - `JsonStorage` -> `JsonDb`
  - `GCSJsonStorage` -> `GCSJsonDb`
</Accordion>

## Memory

- With the above changes to storage, memory has been simplified.
- `memory` has been removed from `Agent` and `Team`. Instead memory is enabled with `enable_user_memories: bool` (like before) and persisted in the `db` instance.
- Changes to how memories are created can still be done by overriding the `MemoryManager` class on `Agent` or `Team`. E.g. `Agent(memory_manager=MyMemoryManager())`.
- `AgentMemory` and `TeamMemory` have been removed.

## Knowledge

- Knowledge has been completely reworked. See full details in the [Knowledge](/basics/knowledge/) section.
- You now define a single `Knowledge` instance for all types of content. Files (PDF, CSV, etc.), URLs, and other.
- The agent can still use your knowledge base to search for information at runtime. All existing RAG implementations are still supported.
- Added **full `async` support** for embedding models and vector DBs. This has a significant impact on performance and is a major speed improvement when adding content to the knowledge base using `knowledge.add_content_async(...)`.
- `AgentKnowledge` and all other knowledge base classes have been removed.
- Import locations for `embedder`, `document`, `chunking`, `reranker` and `reader` have been moved to `agno.knowledge`. See [examples](/basics/knowledge/overview) for more details.

## Tools updates

- General:
  - Since Agents and Teams are now stateless, using attributes from the agent/team object inside a function will give you access to the attributes set on initialisation of that agent/team. E.g. `agent.session_state` should not be used, instead `session_state` can now be directly accessed and would have the "current" state of the session.
  - A new flow allows images, audio and video files generated during tool execution to be passed back in a `FunctionExecutionResult` object and this will ensure these artifacts are made available to the model and agent as needed.
- All tools that handle media (e.g. image generation tools) now correctly add this generated media to the `RunOutput`, but also make it available for subsequent model calls.
- The interface of almost all the toolkits have been updated for a more consistent experience around switching specific tools on and off. The list of changes is too long to list here. We suggest you take a look at the toolkits you use specifically and how they have been updated.
- `show_results` is now `True` by default for all tools. If you just set `stop_after_tool_call=True` then `show_results` will be automatically set to `True`.
- `images`, `videos`, `audio` and `files` are now available as parameters to tools. See the [documentation](/basics/tools/overview) for more details.

## Media

#### Removals

- **Removed legacy artifact classes**: `ImageArtifact`, `VideoArtifact`, `AudioArtifact`, and `AudioResponse` classes have been completely removed in favor of unified media classes.

#### New Unified Media Architecture

- **Unified `Image` class**: Now serves all use cases (input, output, artifacts) with standardized `content: Optional[bytes]` field for raw image data
- **Unified `Audio` class**: Replaces both `AudioArtifact` and `AudioResponse` with consistent byte-based content storage and additional fields like `transcript`, `expires_at`, `sample_rate`, and `channels`
- **Unified `Video` class**: Updated to handle all video use cases with standardized content handling and metadata fields
- **Enhanced `File` class**: Updated to work seamlessly across agent, team, workflow, and toolkit contexts

#### New Methods and Features

- **`from_base64()` class method**: Added to `Image`, `Audio`, and `Video` classes for creating instances from base64-encoded content (automatically converts to raw bytes)
- **`get_content_bytes()` method**: Retrieves content as raw bytes, handling loading from URLs or file paths
- **`to_base64()` method**: Converts content to base64 string for transmission/storage
- **`to_dict()` method**: Enhanced serialization with optional base64 content inclusion

#### Content Standardization

- **Byte-based storage**: All media content is now stored as raw bytes (`Optional[bytes]`) instead of mixed string/bytes formats
- **Automatic validation**: Model validators ensure exactly one content source (`url`, `filepath`, or `content`) is provided
- **Auto-generated IDs**: Media objects automatically generate UUIDs when not provided

## Logging

- Added support for custom loggers. See the [documentation](/basics/custom-logging) for more details.

## Agent updates

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Updates to Metrics">
  - Metrics have been simplified and cleaned up.
  - There are now 3 levels of metrics:
    - `Message.metrics` -> Metrics for each message (assistant, tool, etc.).
    - `RunOutput.metrics` -> Aggregated metrics for the whole run.
    - `AgentSession.metrics` -> Aggregated metrics for the whole session.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Updates to Knowledge">
  - `knowledge` is now an instance of `Knowledge` instead of `AgentKnowledge`.

  - Added `get_session_state` to retrieve the session state from a session.
  - Added `get_session_summary` to retrieve the session summary from a session.
  - Because `Agent` is now stateless, `agent_session`, `session_metrics`, `run_id`, `run_input`, `run_messages` and `run_response` as "sticky" agent attributes have been removed.
  - Because `Agent` is now stateless, `images`, `videos`, `audio` are no longer available as agent attributes. Instead these can be accessed on the `RunOutput` for a particular run.
  - Removed `team_session_state` and `workflow_session_state`. Only `session_state` is used.
  - Added `enable_agentic_state` to `Agent` and `Team` to allow the agent to update the session state with a tool call.
</Accordion>

## Team updates

<Accordion title="Updates to Team Class">
  - Removed `mode` from `Team`. Instead there are attributes that can be used to control the behavior of the team:
    - `respond_directly` -> If True, the team leader won't process responses from the members and instead will return them directly
    - `delegate_to_all_members` -> If True, the team leader will delegate tasks to all members simultaneously, instead of one by one. When running async (using `arun`) members will run concurrently.
