Agno supports using Firestore as a storage backend for Agents using the `FirestoreDb` class.

## Usage

You need to provide a `project_id` parameter to the `FirestoreDb` class. Firestore will connect automatically using your Google Cloud credentials.

```python firestore_for_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.firestore import FirestoreDb
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

PROJECT_ID = "agno-os-test"  # Use your project ID here

# Setup the Firestore database
db = FirestoreDb(project_id=PROJECT_ID)

agent = Agent(
    db=db,
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    add_history_to_context=True,
)

agent.print_response("How many people live in Canada?")
agent.print_response("What is their national anthem called?")
```

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure your gcloud project is enabled with Firestore. Reference [Firestore documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/create-database-server-client-library)
2. Install dependencies: `pip install openai google-cloud-firestore agno`
3. Make sure your gcloud project is set up and you have the necessary permissions to access Firestore
