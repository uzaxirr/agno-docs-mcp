description: Learn how to use Anthropic's beta features with Agno.

Anthropic's `betas` are experimental features extending the capabilities of Claude models.

They are supported via the `betas` parameter when initializing the `Claude` model:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(
        # Activate the context management beta
        betas=["context-management-2025-06-27"],
    ),
)
```

## Example

```python
import anthropic
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

# Setup the beta features we want to use
betas = ["context-1m-2025-08-07"]
model = Claude(betas=betas)

# Note: you can see all beta features available in your Anthropic version like this:
all_betas = anthropic.types.AnthropicBetaParam
print("\n=== All available Anthropic beta features ===")
print(f"- {'\n- '.join(all_betas.__args__[1].__args__)}")
print("=============================================\n")

agent = Agent(model=model, debug_mode=True)

# The beta features are now activated, the model will have access to use them.
agent.print_response("What is the weather in Tokyo?")
```

## Natively Supported Beta Features

Some beta features will require additional configuration. For example, the context management beta requires you to configure the Agent Skills feature will require you to specify which document formats to work with.
In that case, you will need to use the `betas` parameter to activate the beta feature, and provide the rest of the configuration via the relevant parameter.

You can check how to use each one of these beta features in our docs.

Here are the ones supported natively with Agno:
