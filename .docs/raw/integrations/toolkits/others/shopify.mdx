**ShopifyTools** enable an Agent to analyze sales data, product performance, and customer insights using the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

## Prerequisites

The following example requires a Shopify Admin API access token with appropriate scopes.

Set the following environment variables:
- `SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME`: Your Shopify shop name (e.g., "my-store" from my-store.myshopify.com)
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Shopify Admin API access token

You can get your access token from: Shopify Admin > Settings > Apps and sales channels > Develop apps

**Required API scopes:**
- `read_orders` (for order and sales data)
- `read_products` (for product information)
- `read_customers` (for customer insights)
- `read_analytics` (for analytics data)

## Example

The following agent will analyze sales data and provide insights.

```python shopify_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.shopify import ShopifyTools

sales_agent = Agent(
    name="Sales Analyst",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[ShopifyTools()],
    instructions=[
        "You are a sales analyst for an e-commerce store using Shopify.",
        "Help the user understand their sales performance, product trends, and customer behavior.",
    ],
    markdown=True,
    add_datetime_to_context=True,  # This is important to get the current date and time in the context
)

sales_agent.print_response("What are my top 5 selling products this month?")
```
