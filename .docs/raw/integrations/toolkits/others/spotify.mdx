**SpotifyTools** enable an Agent to access Spotify API to search for songs.

## Prerequisites

The following example requires the `spotify` library and an API key from [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/).

The only external library needed for spotify is the `httpx`. Which is already a dependency of Agno.

## Example

The following agent will search for songs using Spotify API.

```python cookbook/14_tools/spotify_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.spotify import SpotifyTools

agent = Agent(tools=[SpotifyTools()])
agent.print_response("Search for songs by 'Taylor Swift'")
```
