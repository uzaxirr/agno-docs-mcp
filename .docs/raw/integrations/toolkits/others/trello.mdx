## Prerequisites

The following examples require the `trello` library and Trello API credentials which can be obtained by following Trello's developer documentation.

```shell
pip install -U trello
```

Set the following environment variables:

```shell
export TRELLO_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export TRELLO_API_SECRET="YOUR_API_SECRET"
export TRELLO_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Example

The following agent will create a board called `ai-agent` and inside it create list called `todo` and `doing` and inside each of them create card called `create agent`.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.trello import TrelloTools

agent = Agent(
    instructions=[
        "You are a Trello management assistant that helps organize and manage Trello boards, lists, and cards",
        "Help users with tasks like:",
        "- Creating and organizing boards, lists, and cards",
        "- Moving cards between lists",
        "- Retrieving board and list information",
        "- Managing card details and descriptions",
        "Always confirm successful operations and provide relevant board/list/card IDs and URLs",
        "When errors occur, provide clear explanations and suggest solutions",
    ],
    tools=[TrelloTools()],
    )

agent.print_response(
    "Create a board called ai-agent and inside it create list called 'todo' and 'doing' and inside each of them create card called 'create agent'",
    stream=True,
)

```
