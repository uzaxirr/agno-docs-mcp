**Zoom** enables an Agent to interact with Zoom, allowing it to schedule meetings, manage recordings, and handle various meeting-related operations through the Zoom API. The toolkit uses Zoom's Server-to-Server OAuth authentication for secure API access.

## Prerequisites

The Zoom toolkit requires the following setup:

1. Install required dependencies:

```shell
pip install requests
```

2. Set up Server-to-Server OAuth app in Zoom Marketplace:

   - Go to [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)
   - Click "Develop" → "Build App"
   - Choose "Server-to-Server OAuth" app type
   - Configure the app with required scopes:
     - `/meeting:write:admin`
     - `/meeting:read:admin`
     - `/recording:read:admin`
   - Note your Account ID, Client ID, and Client Secret

3. Set up environment variables:

```shell
export ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

## Example Usage

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.zoom import ZoomTools

# Initialize Zoom tools with credentials
zoom_tools = ZoomTools(
    account_id="your_account_id",
    client_id="your_client_id",
    client_secret="your_client_secret"
)

# Create an agent with Zoom capabilities
agent = Agent(tools=[zoom_tools])

# Schedule a meeting
response = agent.print_response("""
Schedule a team meeting with the following details:
- Topic: Weekly Team Sync
- Time: Tomorrow at 2 PM UTC
- Duration: 45 minutes
""", markdown=True)
```
