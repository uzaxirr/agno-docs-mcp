Companies want to build AI products, run them as a secure containerized service in their cloud, and monitor, test, and manage their agentic system with a beautiful UI. Doing this takes far more than calling an LLM API in a loop, it requires a thoughtfully designed agentic platform.

Agno provides the unified stack for building, running and managing multi-agent systems:

- **Framework**: Build agents, multi-agent teams and workflows with memory, knowledge, state, guardrails, HITL, context compression, MCP, A2A and 100+ toolkits.
- **AgentOS Runtime**: Run your multi-agent system in production with a secure, stateless runtime and ready to use integration endpoints.
- **AgentOS Control Plane**: Test, monitor and manage AgentOS deployments across environments with full operational visibility. Build your own web interface or use the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).

## Example

Here’s an example of an Agent that connects to an MCP server, manages conversation state in a database, is served using a FastAPI application that you can chat using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).

```python agno_agent.py lines
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

# ************* Create Agent *************
agno_agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Agent",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-5"),
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
    tools=[MCPTools(transport="streamable-http", url="https://docs.agno.com/mcp")],
    add_history_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# ************* Create AgentOS *************
agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agno_agent])
app = agent_os.get_app()

# ************* Run AgentOS *************
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent_os.serve(app="agno_agent:app", reload=True)
```

## AgentOS - Production Runtime for Multi-Agent Systems

Building Agents is easy, running them as a secure, scalable service is hard. AgentOS solves this by providing a high performance runtime for serving multi-agent systems in production. Key features include:

1. **Pre-built FastAPI app**: AgentOS includes a ready-to-use FastAPI app for running your agents, teams and workflows. This gives you a significant head start when building an AI product.

2. **Integrated Control Plane**: The [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) connects directly to your runtime, so you can test, monitor and manage your system in real time with full operational visibility.

3. **Private by Design**: AgentOS runs entirely in your cloud, ensuring complete data privacy. No data leaves your environment, making it ideal for security conscious enterprises..

When you run the `agno_agent.py` script shared above, you get a FastAPI app that you can connect to the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com). Here's what it looks like in action:

## The Complete Agentic Solution

Agno provides the complete solution for companies building agentic systems:

- The fastest framework for building agents, multi-agent teams and agentic workflows.
- A ready-to-use FastAPI app that gets you building AI products on day one.
- A control plane for testing, monitoring and managing your system.

We bring a novel architecture that no other framework provides, your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it from your browser. You don't need to send data to any external services or pay retention costs, you get complete privacy and control.

## Get started

If you're new to Agno, follow the [quickstart](/get-started/quickstart) to build your first Agent and run it using the AgentOS.

After that, checkout the [examples gallery](/examples/use-cases/agents/overview) and build real-world applications with Agno.
