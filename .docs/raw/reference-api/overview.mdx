---

Welcome to the comprehensive API reference for the Agno AgentOS API. This RESTful API enables you to programmatically interact with your AgentOS instance, manage agents, teams, and workflows, and integrate AgentOS capabilities into your applications.

## Authentication

AgentOS supports bearer-token authentication via a single Security Key.

- When `OS_SECURITY_KEY` environment variable is set on the server, all routes require:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <OS_SECURITY_KEY>
```

- When `OS_SECURITY_KEY` is not set, authentication is disabled for that instance.

See the dedicated guide: [Secure your AgentOS with a Security Key](/agent-os/security).

## Core Resources

The AgentOS API is organized around several key resources:
