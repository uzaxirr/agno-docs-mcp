After creating your codebase, the next step is to get it up and running locally using docker

`cd` into the `agent-infra-docker` directory

```bash
cd agent-infra-docker
```

Start your Agent Infra Docker using the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
ag infra up
```

```bash shorthand
ag infra up dev:docker
```

```bash expanded notation
ag infra up --env dev --infra docker
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also use the `docker compose up -d --build` command to start your Agent Infra Docker:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
docker compose up -d --build
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm using Docker Compose, and give it a few seconds for the Docker image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the Docker dashboard.

- Open localhost:7777/docs to view the FastAPI routes for the AgentOS instance.
- Open localhost:5432 to view the PostgreSQL database.

## Stop the containers

Play around with the AgentOS and stop it using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
ag infra down
```

</CodeGroup>

or using the `docker compose down` command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
docker compose down
```

</CodeGroup>

## Restart the containers

Any changes you make to the codebase will be reflected in the running container. You can restart the container using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
ag infra restart
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>

When updating environment variables, you need to restart the container for the changes to take effect.
