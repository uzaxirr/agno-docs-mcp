After creating your codebase, the next step is to get it up and running locally using docker.

`cd` into the `agent-infra-railway` directory

```bash
cd agent-infra-railway
```

Start your Agent Infra Railway using the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
docker compose up -d --build
```

</CodeGroup>

Give it a few seconds for the Docker image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the Docker dashboard.

- Open http://localhost:8000/docs to view the FastAPI routes for the AgentOS instance.
- Open http://localhost:5432 to view the PostgreSQL database.

## Stop Agent Infra Railway

Play around with the AgentOS and stop it using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
docker compose down
```

</CodeGroup>
