After creating your codebase, the next step is to get it up and running on Railway.

1. Make sure you are in the `agent-infra-railway` directory. If you are not, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
  cd agent-infra-railway
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Install the Railway CLI (More details [here](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli)):

<CodeGroup>
```bash terminal
brew install railway
```

</CodeGroup>

3. Login to your Railway account:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
railway login
```

</CodeGroup>

Note: Remember to either export the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

4. Run the deployment script:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
./scripts/railway_up.sh
```

</CodeGroup>

5. Monitor the deployment (Optional):

<CodeGroup>
```bash terminal
railway logs --service agent_os
```

</CodeGroup>

6. Access the application via the Railway UI:

<CodeGroup>
```bash terminal
railway open
```

</CodeGroup>

7. In the CLI, you will see the domain of your application. Click on it to access your AgentOS FastAPI server. You can navigate to `<railway-domain>/docs` to access the API documentation.

8. On Agno AgentOS UI, connect your OS with the domain you just created.

- Open the [Agno AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).
- Connect your OS with `<railway-domain>` as the endpoint.

### Updating your Railway Deployment

To update your Railway deployment, you can run the following command after making changes to the application:

```bash terminal
railway up --service agent_os -d
```

This will trigger a new deployment of your application by creating a new docker image and deploying it to Railway.

### Stopping your Railway Deployment

To stop your Railway deployment, you can run the following command:

```bash terminal
railway down --service agent_os
railway down --service pgvector
```
